I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it."
Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India.""

Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it."
Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India.""

Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it."
Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century.

Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it."
Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it."
Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it."
Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it."
Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
"(Avoid) clich√©d plot line, with ludicrous VFX",damdee8,10-May-17,"Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, ""the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals"". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clich√©d plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more."
Very conveniently gets concluded,dineshprakash,28-Apr-17,"Its again visually breathtaking but creatively, even difficult to find it average. They project, a would have to be crowned prince has suggested by his beloved Raj Mata to visit the kingdom in disguise so he can understand public problems but you do know it is just so he can find his lady love. Prince falls in love with first glance as expected, together they fight against goons and finally she takes him along!! After few scenes, they fall in love with each other. Raj Mata sends proposal of marriage of her another son with that Princess, which is get assumed by female side that it is for staying Price's marriage proposal. I didn't find anything exciting in all this, which consumes more than one hour of first half of film. Its very oblivious screenplay so I don't mind to writing about it here. Then second half is full of action with the help of VFX. Even the million dollar question which was tossed in first part, answer is just worth few thousand bucks. You feel that even they were so anxious to conceive any brilliant answer which could have matched the hype created but finally came with the answer just for sake of it. There is a small conspiracy for shock value in pre climax but you know that what is going to be happen. Climax fight is so long, offering nothing new. Even at a point it reminds strongly of Robot's climax. Background in climax, with some mantras chanting in lunatic way at different pitch, is not exciting but sheer headache, at least for me it actually happened. It hammered ruthlessly my eardrums. Performance wise all are average and undoubtedly loud."
The excessively generic pool of horrible film tropes,prathikofficial,6-May-17,"I must start with applauding two things that this movie has shown us. Firstly, we like overpriced but useless things (case in point, our obsession with Mercedes). Half the crowd that has seen this movie has done so to see the ""extravagance"". Secondly, we must appreciate the promotions. While we see the obvious success of Prabhas promoting this movie using Tropicana, we are left to wonder whether we should have Rajnikanth promote Heinz ketchup for his next.This movie is rife with references (all unintentional I hope). A chariot scene that has the technological advancement of a ""Ben Hur"" parody from the 70's. Slow motion sequences that look like the leftovers of the puke-worthy drama in ""300"". To round it all up, a script that is reminiscent of the ""lion king"" trilogy (archetypal).This movie is the bane of Indian cinema. It is deeply saddening to see the Indian cinema industry fall so hard on its back. Maybe this movie should be given to us, Film students, as a crash course on what not to do when directing a movie. Despite all intents and purposes, you will leave the theater not comprehending the general lack of the two and a half hours you spent there.The only thing this film reminds us of is that of the tale of ""King Solomon and the spider"". Rajamouli is the spider, who will not give up despite his many failures. The crowd that watches this movie and hails him as a God, just ask yourself this. How dare you put him on a pedestal that worships people like Orson Welles, Frank Coppola, Charles Chaplin, and even the great Indian Guru Dutt."
A Third Class Movie,nmtpaite,4-May-17,"GuysThis is nothing but a Glorified TV Series.The movie has no logic except loud screams, continuous Intros, Stupid Songs, Pathetic hairy actors and cartoonish VFX.Its like those movies in Telugu where the hero kills goons with banana, but with a serious note.Go watch this third class movie and have fun."
Very predictable.. Not worth the hype,oh_stranger_oh,28-Apr-17,"To be frank, I was not so keen to watch the movie on the first day, but as my friends' comments and reviews were pouring in, I decided to catch the matin√©e show today, the first day.And as I have anticipated, the movie is not up to the mark, at least surely not as much as it flashed all around.There are good movies, there are great movies. But good movies hyped as great movies actually always fall short of expectations and become average movies, that's what exactly happened here.The movie started with the stories of flashback, we see Bahubali moving out of Mahismati with Katappa, ending up finding his lady love, as usual romance, entering Bhallaldev and playing all dirty politics to keep his step brother away from the throne. Big brother happily left his deserving throne and marry his lady love, then more conspiracy by the jealous brother who's now the king and at last successful killing Bahubali and prison his wife. From here it's the continuation of the first part.Acting is good, at least by all the central characters, especially Sathyaraj who had the lion's share of screen presence. Anushka and Prabhas did a good job. Rana stood out though had limited opportunities. Actually, He was the only one who looked authentic.Now the biggest part of the movie, ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali?"", we movie goers who can analyze stories have figured it out long back, right after the first part. Hint: The same reason why Bhishma though fond of Pandavas and supported them, fought against them. There was no surprise at all actually.We have seen many such movies, An honest upright warrior, and prince about to be the king, a badass villain who's also his brother conspire against him and get him killed. Then his son comes back for a revenge. A very clich√©d effort.The graphics are so so, though I am not very convinced. The movie almost looks like an animation movie. I really felt director should have concentrated on the story more, at least there should be some twists and turns, there could be breakout villain. but it was very plain and simple.In the end in a lighter note, there's a hidden lesson for married men. It shows what happens when you let your mom and wife gets into a fight and you end up supporting your wife, but then, if support your mom you are a Momma's boy and if you support your wife you are a wife's puppet. Horn of Dilemma of course.... :D :DConclusion: One-time watch as per me."
As lame as the first one,ninadmauskar,1-May-17,"This movie is as lame as the first movie. I am also disappointed that the audience liked this movie - just goes to show anything works.The plot is weak, predictable, and similar to any South Indian movie where the protagonist goes through hardships, someone gets murdered, and someone seeks revenge. Too many South Indian melodramatic movies have the same story line. Key disappointments are as follows:1. Tamanna Bhatia has 0 dialogues 2. Tamanna Bhatia's story has no reference in the movie. The role of the revel group is unclear 3. Katappa is shown as powerful, but his personality, figure, persona, and body language is quite the contrary, as in, weak, feeble, emotional, and helpless. 4. Action sequences are ridiculous. The most disappointing and also the funniest part of the movie, particularly how soldiers are propelled into the kingdom using cocunut trees. 5. Ramaya's, the queen mother's performance is too melodramatic. A queen should be shown as strong, political, and powerful. Ramaya is shown as a melodramatic woman with extrapolate daughter expressions. 6. Protagonist looks weak as compared to the antagonist. I was rooting for the antagonist. 7. The plot is weak, there is nothing new. 8. Why dis the Adivasi army attack the kingdom in part 1 is never discussed / described. I thought the war in part 1 was totally random. 9. What happened to the love story between young Bahubali and Tamanna Bhatia? 10. Last 15-20 mins seemed like a ""wrap up"" job, where the director wanted to finish and wind up real quick.Overall, I recommend not spending any money for watching this movie in the theatres. Watch it at home on one of the streaming websites. Generally very disappointing, but I am glad that it got over."
RIP Physics and Gravity,ddpower,8-May-17,"Ahh finally got to watch, the so-called most anticipated magnum opus by SS Rajamouli. To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection."
Its more of an extended jewelry advertisement.,sheshamaro,5-May-17,"Its more of an jewelry advertisement, was so horrible and everyone trips and falls allowing the hero to either come up with a plan or to showcase his CGI/ VFX talents.The effects were overused, i could see shades of movie 300, Lord of the rings, Brave heart and few other scenes being copied. its a shame we still do it, even for a movie of this hype.It felt like, i was held up in a cardboard box surrounded by gold, diamonds and Jewelry.Am done getting up my hopes on this kinda Cinema."
An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,afsalthodupuzha,29-Apr-17,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__"
typical masala trash,rohitarora-mit,30-May-17,"I don't come to write reviews here ever but had to write one for this garbage for sure. Now I, for one, liked the first part. Not because of its VFX, not at all, but because of the storytelling. The VFX of the first movie were definitely over-hyped and were maybe better than your typical bollywood crap but nowhere in the league of an average Hollywood movie. I think they were worse than that of Magadheera for that matter. But I still loved the movie because I felt there was a wonderful story waiting to be discovered in this entire series and it was being told in a very nice way, innovative for an Indian movie.Coming to the second part now. It's utter nonsense. Here, I said it. VFX are a huge step down from the first movie and there are a lot of scenes, where you can tell that the set or the fight is absolutely fake. But as I said, I don't judge Indian movies purely on VFX ever because I know that our budget can not match that of Hollywood. The biggest disappointment for me was the storyline, or the lack of it, and the way it was told.The first half had almost no story development. It was filled with the same old overused cheap gimmicks that have been done in like a hundred Indian movies. Hero is champ but he acts like a dumb person and ends up wooing heroine. Crap. Highly predictable. The director turned Katappa, one of the biggest shines of the first movie for me, into a joker just to appease the mass.Now, I didn't have any great interest in why Katappa killed Bahubali. I think everyone had this clue that it had to have happened on the orders of Sivagami, and so it was also obvious that she must have been duped by her husband and son, still, the curiosity was to know how. And boy did that disappoint!! I don't know how anyone can take that thread of a storyline and fast as the wind of a story development, for an answer to the question that had become the centre of interest of millions of people in last two- three years. It was pure nonsense. In an era when we have Game of Thrones to understand the depth of politics that kings and warriors can connive, this thing felt like coming right out of an early 90s' Indian movie. And people are satisfied with it???It just dampens my belief in our people's ability to think. We just accept any half-baked poorly conceived idea for a plot. And it is that because of which our writers don't take the pain to think deeply over the plot lines.Deeply disappointed by the movie. I had high hopes but I should have known better. Unfortunately, the type of hype this movie has received is going to spoil Indian cinema's image everywhere. People all over the world won't come to know that we are also capable of making Drishyam; they would remember us with Bahubali 2."
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,puranjan163,28-Apr-17,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria)."
Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,SAMTHEBESTEST,28-Apr-17,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience.

It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while.

Baahubali 2 disappointed,sanakhan-91137,29-Apr-17,Baahubali 2 is a OK movie. Disappointed with the movie. 1st part is far better than Baahubali 2. Action in the movie is not good its like we are watching a cartoon on some of part in the movie specially in the End war. We wait for the Baahubali 2 but its disappointed because the expectation was very high after part 1. 5 out of 10.
Expectations soiled,vinodemails,1-May-17,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbeliefExp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skillsExp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retributionExp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wastedExp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a weekAll in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'."
Hilarious piece of Junk,ajay-bellubbi14,22-May-17,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now."
one can sleep after while,wathareprasanna,5-May-17,VFX are not up to the mark. Nothing is new. Typical Indian story. I would prefer cartoon movie over this movie. Please Indians don't waste your money on such cartoon. Some scenes are meaningless and some do not have to do anything with story line. By the way good for kids. One can sleep after while but music is quite good
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,kalyan-kancherla,5-Jun-17,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics."
I enjoyed this movie,MrHeraclius,23-Feb-20,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters."
Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017),santhosh-10290,1-Jan-18,The movie was fantastic. Everyone acted very well in the movie. VFX and Graphics in the movie was amazing. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Amazing movie.
The epic epic continues,jamesrupert2014,11-Aug-17,"Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond)."
Baahubali 2 is a shallow yet satisfying end to the saga,the_horned_owl,27-Apr-17,"So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clich√©d was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?"
EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,its_Suvo,30-Apr-17,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts.
The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!"
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,PimpinAinttEasy,19-May-17,"I watched this only because my wife insisted that I accompany her. Having hated part 1, I thought I would calm myself down with a few beers before embarking on what would be an assault on everything that I considered to be important for a film to be considered a classic. Alas, I live in the pious state of Kerala where alcohol is partially prohibited and hence I was unable to procure any alcohol on the particular day. I braced myself for what would almost certainly be a torturous experience.I was treated to mediocre special effects and over the top action scenes which even a little boy would find hard to take seriously. The actor Prabhas was insufferable - his face expressions were grotesque. He phones it in most of the time. Anushka Shetty was very pretty but her performance during the action scenes made me chuckle. Another reviewer compared the chariot scene to the famous chariot racing sequence in Benhur. But I was reminded of the chariot chase sequence in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis.The film did feature some grand vistas and sets like the elephant statue that is carved out of the rock but still attached to the rocky mountain. This is when Prabhas and Anushka first arrive in Magarmazhi on a boat. The Kali statue with fire burning out of various parts when Dagubatti and Nasser are plotting Prabhas' murder was also remarkable. Dagubatti's coronation scene had a lot of potential. All these things indicated to me that at least some people with imagination were working behind the scenes. But everything about the film is shoddy and Rajamouli the director must take the blame for the shoddiness. Once again, the Indian public has elevated a mediocre product made by a bunch of mediocre artists into a worldwide blockbuster that has now grossed 1,500 crores. Some may think that this is a great achievement. But it is not. We as a nation are promoting and spreading mediocrity."
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,paderthi-vijay,23-Jun-17,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece."
