I enjoyed this movie,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.",baahubali 2  the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline  but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes  interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects  colorful and exciting  it is also exhilarating  though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story  but above all else  both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters ,"baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film visually dazzling behold great costumes, interiors phenomenal set pieces special effects. colorful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film usually dazzling behold great costumes, interior phenomena set pieces special effects. colourful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","['baahubali', '2', 'conclusion', 'quite', 'good', 'predecessor', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'storyline', 'film', 'usually', 'dazzling', 'behold', 'great', 'costumes', 'interior', 'phenomena', 'set', 'pieces', 'special', 'effects', 'colourful', 'exciting', 'also', 'exhilarating', 'though', 'silly', 'action', 'thus', 'succeeds', 'pretty', 'good', 'conclusion', 'story', 'else', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'incredibly', 'epic', 'scope', 'world', 'building', 'aspect', 'much', 'better', 'american', 'blockbusters']",baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomena set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori els film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust,baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomenon set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori el film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust

EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts. The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. That final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the CONCLUSION is satisfying!","it's a nearly perfect film ! it has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts. the director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! during the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. there're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. that final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the conclusion is satisfying!","it's a nearly perfect film ! it has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts. the director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! during the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. there're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there. that final fight between the two is well choreographed, shot and the conclusion is satisfying!",it s a nearly perfect film   it has some bad cringe moments  cheap special effects but these things can t take u away from good parts  the director has a vision   the thing that lacks in most indian filmmakers  and he executed it perfectly  during the first quarter the film can be boring to some people   they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love  there re plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another  these things can make u laugh  climax wall jump too   there are plenty to dramatic  emotionally impactful  goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there  that final fight between the two is well choreographed  shot and the conclusion is satisfying ,"nearly perfect film ! bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects things can't take u away good parts. director vision ( thing lacks indian filmmakers) executed perfectly! first quarter film boring people , stretched little bit bahubali goes find love. there're plenty crazy action sequences bahubali jumps one bull another, things make u laugh( climax wall jump too). plenty dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments keep u there. final fight two well choreographed, shot conclusion satisfying!","nearly perfect film ! bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects things can't take u away good parts. director vision ( thing lacks indian filmmakers) executed perfectly! first quarter film boring people , stretched little bit bahubali goes find love. there're plenty crazy action sequence bahubali jumps one bull another, things make u laugh( climax wall jump too). plenty dramatic, emotional impactful, goosebumps inducing moments keep u there. final fight two well choreographed, shot conclusion satisfying!","['nearly', 'perfect', 'film', 'bad/cringe', 'moments', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'u', 'away', 'good', 'parts', 'director', 'vision', 'thing', 'lacks', 'indian', 'filmmakers', 'executed', 'perfectly', 'first', 'quarter', 'film', 'boring', 'people', 'stretched', 'little', 'bit', 'bahubali', 'goes', 'find', 'love', 'there', ""'re"", 'plenty', 'crazy', 'action', 'sequence', 'bahubali', 'jumps', 'one', 'bull', 'another', 'things', 'make', 'u', 'laugh', 'climax', 'wall', 'jump', 'too', 'plenty', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'impactful', 'goosebumps', 'inducing', 'moments', 'keep', 'u', 'there', 'final', 'fight', 'two', 'well', 'choreographed', 'shot', 'conclusion', 'satisfying']",nearli perfect film bad/cring moment cheap special effect thing ca n't take u away good part director vision thing lack indian filmmak execut perfectli first quarter film bore peopl stretch littl bit bahubali goe find love there 're plenti crazi action sequenc bahubali jump one bull anoth thing make u laugh climax wall jump too plenti dramat emot impact goosebump induc moment keep u there final fight two well choreograph shot conclus satisfi,nearli perfect film bad/cring moment cheap special effect thing ca n't take u away good part director vision thing lack indian filmmak execut perfectli first quarter film bore peopl stretch littl bit bahubali goe find love there 're plenti crazi action sequenc bahubali jump one bull anoth thing make u laugh climax wall jump too plenti dramat emot impact goosebump induc moment keep u there final fight two well choreograph shot conclus satisfi
A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,,,,,,,[],,
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.

People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.

When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.

Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.

It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.

1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.

2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.

3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.

Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.","why so much hatred on this movie. i wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. i'm surprised not even

An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.

The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.

The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.

The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.

A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.

The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.

Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.

Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.

Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__","'baahubali -

typical masala trash,,,,,,,[],,
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. in the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. in the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences indian movies have ever seen. the songs are not that appealing but okay. overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. so don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how indian movies have gone to a whole new level. i am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known;

Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.

Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.

Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.

Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.

Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.

Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.

Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.

Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.

Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it.","bahubali : the conclusion review - a film which has taken audience anticipation to next level finally released today and

Expectations soiled,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.

Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbelief

Exp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skills

Exp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retribution

Exp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wasted

Exp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a week

All in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.

Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.

However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'.","yes, the movie

Hilarious piece of Junk,,,,,,,[],,
one can sleep after while,,,,,,,[],,
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.

Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.

In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.

Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics.","i really liked baahubali the beginning. though it was not great,it was a good movie. now the second

Don't waste your money or time in this awful movie,,,,,,,[],,
Baahubali 2 is a film that will be remembered across decades,"A strong story line built upon the enriches of Indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. We have a very strong cultural background of Vedas, Puranas and the great mythological epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. I grew up reading these big epics and after so many years I witnessed an epic film - 'Baahubali - A Man with strong arms'. I celebrated this Indian Magnum Opus just like the way I have celebrated all time great blockbusters in Hollywood and Bollywood.

If we can accept the great stories like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings trilogy, the famous Game of thrones series (which has its own heroes following the same dharma - righteous path to combat evil), then we shall also celebrate Baahubali too. SS Rajamouli - (Director) had made sure that we have enough heroic personalities and larger than life characters in our own mythological epic stories. There are many reasons to celebrate the humongous Baahubali 2 too.

Baahubali 2 is not about box office numbers, it is a story which has managed to unite entire India irrespective of state, language, film industry based on a simple question - 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali'?, it is most certain that the direction, power of narration and screenplay has created an impact and liking towards the film. Don't forget, Baahubali 1 - The Beginning had laid the initial footprint two years ago and the first part of the movie was not forgotten.

Baahubali 2 rides on the momentum from where the first part has left. It has it's own filmy moments that deliver goosebumps to the viewers and the famous fight scenes that galore within itself. Claps thud, whistles blow, shouts from the viewers during several moments which cannot be expressed in words. It is a film which doesn't rely solely on VFX, thought it has been touted as the best film with extraordinary visuals. It doesn't disappoint the viewers and the execution was strong enough to make a visual impact.

Baahubali is our own Indian super hero who follows the simple righteous path of Dharma and character is well sculpted. Emphasis is thoroughly laid on every finer detail in the film. Devasena and Sivagami are the two most powerful women characters which one can see in recent times. Bhalaladeva looks intimidatingly venomous through his expressions. Kattappa's is always the go to warrior who bows his head to the King.

Background score of this film has been excellent and it keeps the audience enthralled and entertained. Baahubali's character and it's powerful screen presence gets elevated with magnificent BGM.

Baahubali, undoubtedly is a proud Indian film that broke barriers, it has proved that with a strong subject and excellent directional execution one can reach the sky. Eventually, it is the character Baahubali himself that prevails in every viewer's mind and imagination.

The world wide appreciation as reported from top news channels such as Guardian, Wall street Journal etc has been remarkable. It has set a new benchmark in the Indian film industry and it is striking the doors of Hollywood as it already turned down the some of the newly released Hollywood blockbusters in terms of Box-office collections.

Instead of criticizing the film and finding out flaws in CGI, Indians should stand up and applaud 'Baahubali' for it's impact and contribution to Indian cinema.

My rating is 10/10 and it has been an unbelievable experience watching it on big screen. It is flawless and I take a bow to the hard work put in by the entire cast and crew of the film. It teaches us the sole aspect of belief and execution. SS Rajamouli believed in the subject(Bahubali) with lot of conviction, he braved the odds and he breathed fire and life into it.

The result, we can see everywhere.....thanks to the story teller himself. Baahubali will be remembered across decades and it lives on.....","a strong story line built upon the enriches of indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. we have a very strong cultural background of vedas, puranas and the great mythological epics like ramayana and mahabharata. i grew up reading these big epics and after so many years i witnessed an epic film - 'baahubali -

who says this movie got remarkable vfx graphics?,,,,,,,[],,
An Indian Epic... in true sense of the word!,"Let me begin by saying I was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first half and it didn't feel forced. This movie will grab your attention from the introductory scene (goosebumps worthy) till almost the entire length of the film. It has a high energy throughout and a lot of credit for that goes to the grand visuals along with exceptional acting from all actors, especially Ramya as Shivagami and Prabhas as Amarendra Baahubali.

For me, the most powerful sequence comes in the middle of the movie, this is our GoT moment and this one sequence alone shows the potential of Indian Cinema, you will know what I am talking about once you watch the movie. Another amazing yet subtle thing to notice is how Prabhas has played two different characters, the calm, experienced demeanor of Amarendra Baahubali and the rough- edged, not-groomed persona of Mahendra Baahubali. Kudos to him.

You will notice some over the top action sequences where S. S. Rajamouli has taken liberty to show us fresh imaginative action which adds to the fun factor. The movie does die down towards the end, however that is bound to happen considering the fact that it was adrenaline-pumping for so long.

It takes great directorial vision and deep pockets of producers to make this happen and hopefully the success of this film triggers the rise of more such epics that we can enjoy. This is a must watch. Just the sheer scale of visual effects and production value is breath-taking, no one should miss this.","let me begin by saying i was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first

this.","let me begin by saying i was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first half and it didn't feel forced. this movie will grab your attention from the introductory scene (goosebumps worthy) till almost the entire length of the film. it has a high energy throughout and a lot of credit for that goes to the grand visuals along with exceptional acting from all actors, especially ramya as shivagami and prabhas as amarendra baahubali. for me, the most powerful sequence comes in the middle of the movie, this is our got moment and this one sequence alone shows the potential of indian cinema, you will know what i am talking about once you watch the movie. another amazing yet subtle thing to notice is how prabhas has played two different characters, the calm, experienced demeanor of amarendra baahubali and the rough- edged, not-groomed persona of mahendra baahubali. kudos to him. you will notice some over the top action sequences where s. s. rajamouli has taken liberty to show us fresh imaginative action which adds to the fun factor. the movie does die down towards the end, however that is bound to happen considering the fact that it was

Baahubali -The GOAT,"=====SPOILER FREE====

#BAAHUBALI2 is the best film that has ever been made in Indian cinema and considering the amount of emotions that are attached with this film, it is sure to rank among the classics this world has ever produced.India is blessed to have directors like Rajamouli.His creativity and imagination is beyond comparison.He simply brought the best out of all the characters, all the actors.I haven't seen such VFX's, such cinematography, such screenplay anywhere else.

Coming to acting all the actors have delivered career defining performances be it RANA,ANUSHKA,SATHYARAJ,RAMYA,TAMANNA(for the first part) but the man who has simply changed the rules of the game is PRABHAS. There is a certain kind of royalty that is attached to him yet it is his humane nature that makes him absolutely endearing.What an actor!!!He is the definition of what a Superstar is.

VERDICT-Overall Bollywood will never have the balls to make a film like this ever because films like these require passion, commitment, patience and creativity that Bollywood lacks.MAHABHARATA can only be made by RAJAMOULI and nobody else. BAAHUBALI is a phenomenon that will easily earn a minimum of 1000cr.Nothing can best it in the near future.It is a classic that will be foretold to future generation as the ""Movie of this generation"". Go experience this once in a lifetime event.

RATING-This film can't be rated because of its super humanness, magnanimity and grandeur.You have to see it to believe it.","=====spoiler free==== #baahubali2 is the best film that has ever been made

A nonstop and immersive entertainment !!,"The wait is over, Rajamouli and his crew did it again, 2 hr 47 min nonstop and immersive entertainment.

It is simply another visual wonder, didn't realize when it was over. The style of storytelling was excellent, thought it was bit of slow in the beginning, but slowly it picked up and never looked back. Cinematography, natural landscape, settings and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, a visual journey through the Mahishmati and Kunthala Samrajyam. Also with great performances not only by Prabhas and Rana but equally everyone, Nazar was exceptional and in fact he stole the show.

All my stars go towards the story, beautiful picturization, production value and performances. All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge between two brothers but more like an epic to the intuitive beauty of visual effects. It provides an extremely fascinating and touching experience to those who have an affinity for the mythological stories, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of modern filmmaking for cinema lovers. It's a perfect movie, a film likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. Baahubali – The Conclusion' is visual poetry of the most ancient kind background sceneries, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. Last but not the least, this is equally (if not superior) in par with Baahubali 1.

Good story that should've been spared from cartoonish visual extravaganza!,"First of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. Like many such movies, it had those wow moments with CGI but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. Last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. It had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.","first of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. like many such movies, it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.","first of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. like many such movies, it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.",first of all  not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film  it was an entertaining film from the story perspective  like many such movies  it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war fight sequences or the animals  last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise  it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out ,"first all, taking away credit makers actors film, entertaining film story perspective. like many movies, wow moments cgi overall disappoints cartoonish portrayal war/fight sequences animals. last half hour movie ludicrous part entire movie franchise. much potential something else turned out.","first all, taking away credit makers actors film, entertaining film story perspective. like many moves, now moments chi overall disappoints cartoons portray war/fight sequence animals. last half hour movie ludicrous part entire movie franchise. much potential something else turned out.","['first', 'all', 'taking', 'away', 'credit', 'makers', 'actors', 'film', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'perspective', 'like', 'many', 'moves', 'now', 'moments', 'chi', 'overall', 'disappoints', 'cartoons', 'portray', 'war/fight', 'sequence', 'animals', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'ludicrous', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'franchise', 'much', 'potential', 'something', 'else', 'turned', 'out']",first all take away credit maker actor film entertain film stori perspect like mani move now moment chi overal disappoint cartoon portray war/fight sequenc anim last half hour movi ludicr part entir movi franchis much potenti someth els turn out,first all take away credit maker actor film entertain film stori perspect like mani move now moment chi overal disappoint cartoon portray war/fight sequenc anim last half hour movi ludicr part entir movi franchis much potenti someth el turn out
Over-hyped with very bad VFX,"What is all the hype about? story is like a typical saas-bahu drama and the VFX sucked. I loved the first one, but this one left me disappointed and how. With such a massive budget they could have made something way better than what was delivered. I guess the critics just went with the hype and gave it good ratings. A lot of unreal sequences that make you laugh at some points, (how does a person get on fire and not burn?). If some of these sequences were in a bollywood film, critics and audiences would've trolled it and given the film bad ratings, then why not for this? i'm shocked at why this film earned so much, maybe cause tickets were priced higher than other movies. overall it's just an Over-hyped movie. don't waste money on it. there are better films way better than this which go unnoticed because of low budgets. just because this movie has earned so much it doesn't make it the best.","what is all the hype about?

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic,"Why Kattapa.. Why?? A question probably 1.4+ billion people have been quizzed about for the past 2 years.. Well, I assure you, the wait for that answer was worth more than the stunts, songs or a budget of 2.5 billion INR.. It probably was a combination of one of the most emotionally and frustratingly epic scene I've ever witnessed in Indian cinema.. Just the grandeur of that one scene gave for some goosebumps; for some a prolonged tear jerker; and for some absolute silence with awe.

The Conclusion is helmed on 5 shoulders.. #Prabhas, #Sathyaraj, #RanaDaggubati, #AnushkaShetty and #RamyaKrishan, who have all done their parts well. But the strength of the movie is Prabhas who literally lived the character. The support cast have all done their parts brilliantly.

3 hours 15 minutes: Having watched it in Bahrain, I was surrounded with the thrill of sitting in a cinema in India; whistles, claps and howls of joy; every scene was celebrated.

This movie had a good mix of soulful songs, witty one liners, amazing sound effects, bgm, beautiful locations (both original and visually created), grand sets, hard hitting stunts and touching moments placed aptly.

I had read earlier that the VFX is in par with #TheLordOfTheRings and #HarryPotter.. I would say it is top notch for Indian cinema.

Although I did not understand a word, I watched this movie in the language it was conceived - Telugu. Wanted to keep it as original as possible. It was a challenge coordinating the scene with the subs, but if I'm still recommending it, you must understand how good this movie must have been.

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic.. A theatrical must watch for all.. #Enjoy

First time in 26 years of my life I am writing a review,,,,,,,[],,
Nice Conclusion,"‌Bahubali 2 - Nice movie. Finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of Kattappa's betrayal. Movie is a larger than life sequel of the Rise and Fall and again rise of Amrendra Bahubali. Story is good, Special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). Story starts with a quick recap of the first part. Runs with the love story of Bahubali-Devsena, what led to the sacrifice of Sivagami, murder of Bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. Prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. Anushka is good as a Princess and matched well with Prabhas. Rana is Badly good as the previous one. Both Ramaiya and Naseer did well in their respective roles. Tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. Special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(I thought I'm watching a Hercules movie, LOL). Bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. Even after all this, still there is some disappointment (I don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). Movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'Katappa Killed Bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 - nice movie. finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of kattappa's betrayal. movie is a larger than life sequel of the rise and fall and again rise of amrendra bahubali. story is good, special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). story starts with a quick recap of the first part. runs with the love story of bahubali-devsena, what led to the sacrifice of sivagami, murder of bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. anushka is good as a princess and matched well with prabhas. rana is badly good as the previous one. both ramaiya and naseer did well in their respective roles. tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(i thought i'm watching a hercules movie, lol). bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. even after all this, still there is some disappointment (i don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'katappa killed bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 -

"Average Movie, Insane Audience !","Well we are Indians and we haven't seen an Indian film grossing this sums any time. Is it really worth of crossing 1000 cores mark ??, I may be insane according to many in saying the movie is never a perfect war flick but just a documentary in mixture of Indian sentiments, romantic scenes, immature graphics, loud BM audience elevation scenes and all in all a commercial, nearly 3hours business package, which in the name of REGIONAL PATRIOTISM people poured money tearing their pockets, in lack of genuine judgment. I wonder had any Indian director made a movie like Gladiator, that had a perfect Royal story of unique kind, or had made a movie Titanic, that hit screens way back 1997, it is not a brow rising movement for us, as there would have been temples for the directors. Imagine the graphic content of Harry potter, the very beginner of the series in 2000, can you compare the quality to this great BB2 of 2017 wid17yrs of technology ahead..., and still our people hail it saying THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR BB2, my word !!, the Gods of insanity dancing on our heads. A genuine person of my kind ( I believe so ) should say, should the "" Y "" factor of BB1, (I mean y the man killed the other) carry this huge mess of talk ?? I don't understand, with this kind of technology on update and thousands of movies available, is it this BB2 that should have a bhajan in many parts of modern India. Y not ""Kong"" grab d whole sight of attention despite one of the greatest visuals on screen, imagine a comparison between the bulls scene of BB2 and any scene of Kong and now stick ti your words. When a person says the budget of Kong makes its visuals look much better then a true person must shout out loud ' then why not a movie like Kong had this talk of town and nit an average movie like BB2' well our people don't accept because..., we are Regional Lovers and doubt mind a quality OTHER ! Only two things must clarify this review, either people are "" Frogs in well "" that we know only BB2 so we rate it this high, or they are illiterates, for after watching perfectly classic visual wonders still sticking to "" SAHO BB2 "" becz they understood nothing English !! I conclude saying PV SINDU had the 2nd place of badminton in Olympics recently but got the whole crappy hails and cores of money, while the 1st place Marin took her cash prize to continue life skilled life. I compare Sindu to BB2 and Marin to the really quality movies of west, in India !

Excellent!! Predictable yet it never disappointed me!!,"Hi, guys!! If you have not seen Bahubali 1 & 2 then I would recommend you to watch them now. U will miss the glory of an Indian epic movie if u don't watch it.

This review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. This is not a biased review.

Most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why Katappa killed Bahu Bali, is not a strong reason.

I think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. Or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie.

The reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. Sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. I don't want to spoil the story!!!

I'm a big fan of foreign movies(Hollywood and Korean) because they really make some sensible movies. I was never into Tollywood movies from the beginning. But, I have started watching movies from Tollywood recently and so far ""Bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to Telugu movies.

Reasons:

1. Forget about the VFX, I wasn't expecting much from an Indian movie since the budget is low. But, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and I was impressed by their work.

2. Movie Cast: Yes the cast is excellent, SSR is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. Each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. Even the Junior artists!!!

3. Each & every second that is related to the past is amazing.

4. Though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by SSR is amazing.

5. The movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil.

6. It teaches us ""What exactly the King is?""

7. It teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between King and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant.

8. High in morals, there are so many epic scenes. I don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. You will notice them anyhow.

9. There are situations in which Bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by Dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(Sivagami).

10. The movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. If you believe in yourself you can do anything. (Kumara Varma)

11. It tells us that ""in order to achieve good sometimes you need to do some sacrifices"".

I can write a few more but I'm running out of time I don't want u get bored of by my review.

There are some mistakes in this movie, I think most of the people would not notice them. You will find them in climax as well but who cares by the time you reach climax you will be impressed by the past of Amarendra Bahubali.

Dandalayya song is really awesome, it really suits our King(Prabahs).

The one who is giving a low rating to a movie just because of the mistakes, well I would like to tell them one thing:

""Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL the movie! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger(mistakes) or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!""","hi, guys!! if you have not seen bahubali 1 & 2 then i would recommend you to watch them now. u will miss the glory of an indian epic movie if u don't watch it. this review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. this is not a biased review. most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why katappa killed bahu bali, is not a strong reason. i think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie. the reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. i don't want to spoil the story!!! i'm a big fan of foreign movies(hollywood and korean) because they really make some sensible movies. i was never into tollywood movies from the beginning. but, i have started watching movies from tollywood recently and so far ""bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to telugu movies. reasons: 1. forget about the vfx, i wasn't expecting much from an indian movie since the budget is low. but, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and i was impressed by their work. 2. movie cast: yes the cast is excellent, ssr is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. even the junior artists!!! 3. each & every second that is related to the past is amazing. 4. though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by ssr is amazing. 5. the movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil. 6. it teaches us ""what exactly the king is?"" 7. it teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between king and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant. 8. high in morals, there are so many epic scenes. i don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. you will notice them anyhow. 9. there are situations in which bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(sivagami). 10. the movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. if you believe in yourself you can do anything.

I enjoyed this movie,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.",baahubali 2  the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline  but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes  interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects  colorful and exciting  it is also exhilarating  though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story  but above all else  both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters ,"baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film visually dazzling behold great costumes, interiors phenomenal set pieces special effects. colorful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film usually dazzling behold great costumes, interior phenomena set pieces special effects. colourful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","['baahubali', '2', 'conclusion', 'quite', 'good', 'predecessor', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'storyline', 'film', 'usually', 'dazzling', 'behold', 'great', 'costumes', 'interior', 'phenomena', 'set', 'pieces', 'special', 'effects', 'colourful', 'exciting', 'also', 'exhilarating', 'though', 'silly', 'action', 'thus', 'succeeds', 'pretty', 'good', 'conclusion', 'story', 'else', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'incredibly', 'epic', 'scope', 'world', 'building', 'aspect', 'much', 'better', 'american', 'blockbusters']",baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomena set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori els film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust,baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomenon set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori el film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust

EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts. The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly!

There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there.

A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,,,,,,,[],,
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.

People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.

When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.

Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.

It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.

1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.

2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.

3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.

Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.","why so much hatred on this movie. i wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. i'm surprised not even

An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.

The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.

The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.

The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.

A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.

The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.

Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.

Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.

Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__","'baahubali -

Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. in the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. in the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences indian movies have ever seen. the songs are not that appealing but okay. overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. so don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how indian movies have gone to a whole new level. i am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known;

Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.

Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.

Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.

Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.

Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.

Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.

Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.

Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.

Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it.","bahubali : the conclusion review - a film which has taken audience anticipation to next level finally released today and

Expectations soiled,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.

Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbelief

Exp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skills

Exp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retribution

Exp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wasted

Exp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a week

All in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.

Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.

However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'.","yes, the movie

Hilarious piece of Junk,,,,,,,[],,
one can sleep after while,,,,,,,[],,
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.

Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.

In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.

Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics.","i really liked baahubali the beginning. though it was not great,it was a good movie. now the second

Don't waste your money or time in this awful movie,,,,,,,[],,
Baahubali 2 is a film that will be remembered across decades,"A strong story line built upon the enriches of Indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. We have a very strong cultural background of Vedas, Puranas and the great mythological epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. I grew up reading these big epics and after so many years I witnessed an epic film - 'Baahubali - A Man with strong arms'. I celebrated this Indian Magnum Opus just like the way I have celebrated all time great blockbusters in Hollywood and Bollywood.

If we can accept the great stories like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings trilogy, the famous Game of thrones series (which has its own heroes following the same dharma - righteous path to combat evil), then we shall also celebrate Baahubali too. SS Rajamouli - (Director) had made sure that we have enough heroic personalities and larger than life characters in our own mythological epic stories. There are many reasons to celebrate the humongous Baahubali 2 too.

Baahubali 2 is not about box office numbers, it is a story which has managed to unite entire India irrespective of state, language, film industry based on a simple question - 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali'?, it is most certain that the direction, power of narration and screenplay has created an impact and liking towards the film. Don't forget, Baahubali 1 - The Beginning had laid the initial footprint two years ago and the first part of the movie was not forgotten.

Baahubali 2 rides on the momentum from where the first part has left. It has it's own filmy moments that deliver goosebumps to the viewers and the famous fight scenes that galore within itself. Claps thud, whistles blow, shouts from the viewers during several moments which cannot be expressed in words. It is a film which doesn't rely solely on VFX, thought it has been touted as the best film with extraordinary visuals. It doesn't disappoint the viewers and the execution was strong enough to make a visual impact.

Baahubali is our own Indian super hero who follows the simple righteous path of Dharma and character is well sculpted. Emphasis is thoroughly laid on every finer detail in the film. Devasena and Sivagami are the two most powerful women characters which one can see in recent times. Bhalaladeva looks intimidatingly venomous through his expressions. Kattappa's is always the go to warrior who bows his head to the King.

Background score of this film has been excellent and it keeps the audience enthralled and entertained. Baahubali's character and it's powerful screen presence gets elevated with magnificent BGM.

Baahubali, undoubtedly is a proud Indian film that broke barriers, it has proved that with a strong subject and excellent directional execution one can reach the sky. Eventually, it is the character Baahubali himself that prevails in every viewer's mind and imagination.

The world wide appreciation as reported from top news channels such as Guardian, Wall street Journal etc has been remarkable. It has set a new benchmark in the Indian film industry and it is striking the doors of Hollywood as it already turned down the some of the newly released Hollywood blockbusters in terms of Box-office collections.

Instead of criticizing the film and finding out flaws in CGI, Indians should stand up and applaud 'Baahubali' for it's impact and contribution to Indian cinema.

My rating is 10/10 and it has been an unbelievable experience watching it on big screen. It is flawless and I take a bow to the hard work put in by the entire cast and crew of the film. It teaches us the sole aspect of belief and execution. SS Rajamouli believed in the subject(Bahubali) with lot of conviction, he braved the odds and he breathed fire and life into it.

The result, we can see everywhere.....thanks to the story teller himself. Baahubali will be remembered across decades and it lives on.....","a strong story line built upon the enriches of indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. we have a very strong

who says this movie got remarkable vfx graphics?,,,,,,,[],,
An Indian Epic... in true sense of the word!,"Let me begin by saying I was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first half and it didn't feel forced. This movie will grab your attention from the introductory scene (goosebumps worthy) till almost the entire length of the film. It has a high energy throughout and a lot of credit for that goes to the grand visuals along with exceptional acting from all actors, especially Ramya as Shivagami and Prabhas as Amarendra Baahubali.

For me, the most powerful sequence comes in the middle of the movie, this is our GoT moment and this one sequence alone shows the potential of Indian Cinema, you will know what I am talking about once you watch the movie. Another amazing yet subtle thing to notice is how Prabhas has played two different characters, the calm, experienced demeanor of Amarendra Baahubali and the rough- edged, not-groomed persona of Mahendra Baahubali. Kudos to him.

You will notice some over the top action sequences where S. S. Rajamouli has taken liberty to show us fresh imaginative action which adds to the fun factor. The movie does die down towards the end, however that is bound to happen considering the fact that it was adrenaline-pumping for so long.

It takes great directorial vision and deep pockets of producers to make this happen and hopefully the success of this film triggers the rise of more such epics that we can enjoy. This is a must watch. Just the sheer scale of visual effects and production value is breath-taking, no one should miss this.","let me begin by saying i was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first

Baahubali -The GOAT,"=====SPOILER FREE====

#BAAHUBALI2 is the best film that has ever been made in Indian cinema and considering the amount of emotions that are attached with this film, it is sure to rank among the classics this world has ever produced.India is blessed to have directors like Rajamouli.His creativity and imagination is beyond comparison.He simply brought the best out of all the characters, all the actors.I haven't seen such VFX's, such cinematography, such screenplay anywhere else.

Coming to acting all the actors have delivered career defining performances be it RANA,ANUSHKA,SATHYARAJ,RAMYA,TAMANNA(for the first part) but the man who has simply changed the rules of the game is PRABHAS. There is a certain kind of royalty that is attached to him yet it is his humane nature that makes him absolutely endearing.What an actor!!!He is the definition of what a Superstar is.

VERDICT-Overall Bollywood will never have the balls to make a film like this ever because films like these require passion, commitment, patience and creativity that Bollywood lacks.MAHABHARATA can only be made by RAJAMOULI and nobody else. BAAHUBALI is a phenomenon that will easily earn a minimum of 1000cr.Nothing can best it in the near future.It is a classic that will be foretold to future generation as the ""Movie of this generation"". Go experience this once in a lifetime event.

RATING-This film can't be rated because of its super humanness, magnanimity and grandeur.You have to see it to believe it.","=====spoiler free==== #baahubali2 is the best film that has ever been made

A nonstop and immersive entertainment !!,"The wait is over, Rajamouli and his crew did it again, 2 hr 47 min nonstop and immersive entertainment.

It is simply another visual wonder, didn't realize when it was over. The style of storytelling was excellent, thought it was bit of slow in the beginning, but slowly it picked up and never looked back. Cinematography, natural landscape, settings and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, a visual journey through the Mahishmati and Kunthala Samrajyam. Also with great performances not only by Prabhas and Rana but equally everyone, Nazar was exceptional and in fact he stole the show.

All my stars go towards the story, beautiful picturization, production value and performances. All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge between two brothers but more like an epic to the intuitive beauty of visual effects. It provides an extremely fascinating and touching experience to those who have an affinity for the mythological stories, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of modern filmmaking for cinema lovers. It's a perfect movie, a film likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. Baahubali – The Conclusion' is visual poetry of the most ancient kind background sceneries, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. Last but not the least, this is equally (if not superior) in par with Baahubali 1.

Good story that should've been spared from cartoonish visual extravaganza!,"First of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. Like many such movies, it had those wow moments with CGI but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. Last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. It had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.","first of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. like many such movies, it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.","first of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. like many such movies, it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.",first of all  not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film  it was an entertaining film from the story perspective  like many such movies  it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war fight sequences or the animals  last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise  it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out ,"first all, taking away credit makers actors film, entertaining film story perspective. like many movies, wow moments cgi overall disappoints cartoonish portrayal war/fight sequences animals. last half hour movie ludicrous part entire movie franchise. much potential something else turned out.","first all, taking away credit makers actors film, entertaining film story perspective. like many moves, now moments chi overall disappoints cartoons portray war/fight sequence animals. last half hour movie ludicrous part entire movie franchise. much potential something else turned out.","['first', 'all', 'taking', 'away', 'credit', 'makers', 'actors', 'film', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'perspective', 'like', 'many', 'moves', 'now', 'moments', 'chi', 'overall', 'disappoints', 'cartoons', 'portray', 'war/fight', 'sequence', 'animals', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'ludicrous', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'franchise', 'much', 'potential', 'something', 'else', 'turned', 'out']",first all take away credit maker actor film entertain film stori perspect like mani move now moment chi overal disappoint cartoon portray war/fight sequenc anim last half hour movi ludicr part entir movi franchis much potenti someth els turn out,first all take away credit maker actor film entertain film stori perspect like mani move now moment chi overal disappoint cartoon portray war/fight sequenc anim last half hour movi ludicr part entir movi franchis much potenti someth el turn out
Over-hyped with very bad VFX,"What is all the hype about? story is like a typical saas-bahu drama and the VFX sucked. I loved the first one, but this one left me disappointed and how. With such a massive budget they could have made something way better than what was delivered. I guess the critics just went with the hype and gave it good ratings. A lot of unreal sequences that make you laugh at some points, (how does a person get on fire and not burn?). If some of these sequences were in a bollywood film, critics and audiences would've trolled it and given the film bad ratings, then why not for this? i'm shocked at why this film earned so much, maybe cause tickets were priced higher than other movies. overall it's just an Over-hyped movie. don't waste money on it. there are better films way better than this which go unnoticed because of low budgets. just because this movie has earned so much it doesn't make it the best.","what is all the hype about?

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic,"Why Kattapa.. Why?? A question probably 1.4+ billion people have been quizzed about for the past 2 years.. Well, I assure you, the wait for that answer was worth more than the stunts, songs or a budget of 2.5 billion INR.. It probably was a combination of one of the most emotionally and frustratingly epic scene I've ever witnessed in Indian cinema.. Just the grandeur of that one scene gave for some goosebumps; for some a prolonged tear jerker; and for some absolute silence with awe.

The Conclusion is helmed on 5 shoulders.. #Prabhas, #Sathyaraj, #RanaDaggubati, #AnushkaShetty and #RamyaKrishan, who have all done their parts well. But the strength of the movie is Prabhas who literally lived the character. The support cast have all done their parts brilliantly.

3 hours 15 minutes: Having watched it in Bahrain, I was surrounded with the thrill of sitting in a cinema in India; whistles, claps and howls of joy; every scene was celebrated.

This movie had a good mix of soulful songs, witty one liners, amazing sound effects, bgm, beautiful locations (both original and visually created), grand sets, hard hitting stunts and touching moments placed aptly.

I had read earlier that the VFX is in par with #TheLordOfTheRings and #HarryPotter.. I would say it is top notch for Indian cinema.

Although I did not understand a word, I watched this movie in the language it was conceived - Telugu. Wanted to keep it as original as possible. It was a challenge coordinating the scene with the subs, but if I'm still recommending it, you must understand how good this movie must have been.

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic.. A theatrical must watch for all.. #Enjoy

First time in 26 years of my life I am writing a review,,,,,,,[],,
Nice Conclusion,"‌Bahubali 2 - Nice movie. Finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of Kattappa's betrayal. Movie is a larger than life sequel of the Rise and Fall and again rise of Amrendra Bahubali. Story is good, Special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). Story starts with a quick recap of the first part. Runs with the love story of Bahubali-Devsena, what led to the sacrifice of Sivagami, murder of Bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. Prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. Anushka is good as a Princess and matched well with Prabhas. Rana is Badly good as the previous one. Both Ramaiya and Naseer did well in their respective roles. Tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. Special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(I thought I'm watching a Hercules movie, LOL). Bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. Even after all this, still there is some disappointment (I don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). Movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'Katappa Killed Bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 - nice movie. finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of kattappa's betrayal. movie is a larger than life sequel of the rise and fall and again rise of amrendra bahubali. story is good, special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). story starts with a quick recap of the first part. runs with the love story of bahubali-devsena, what led to the sacrifice of sivagami, murder of bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. anushka is good as a princess and matched well with prabhas. rana is badly good as the previous one. both ramaiya and naseer did well in their respective roles. tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(i thought i'm watching a hercules movie, lol). bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. even after all this, still there is some disappointment (i don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'katappa killed bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 -

"Average Movie, Insane Audience !","Well we are Indians and we haven't seen an Indian film grossing this sums any time. Is it really worth of crossing 1000 cores mark ??, I may be insane according to many in saying the movie is never a perfect war flick but just a documentary in mixture of Indian sentiments, romantic scenes, immature graphics, loud BM audience elevation scenes and all in all a commercial, nearly 3hours business package, which in the name of REGIONAL PATRIOTISM people poured money tearing their pockets, in lack of genuine judgment. I wonder had any Indian director made a movie like Gladiator, that had a perfect Royal story of unique kind, or had made a movie Titanic, that hit screens way back 1997, it is not a brow rising movement for us, as there would have been temples for the directors. Imagine the graphic content of Harry potter, the very beginner of the series in 2000, can you compare the quality to this great BB2 of 2017 wid17yrs of technology ahead..., and still our people hail it saying THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR BB2, my word !!, the Gods of insanity dancing on our heads. A genuine person of my kind ( I believe so ) should say, should the "" Y "" factor of BB1, (I mean y the man killed the other) carry this huge mess of talk ?? I don't understand, with this kind of technology on update and thousands of movies available, is it this BB2 that should have a bhajan in many parts of modern India. Y not ""Kong"" grab d whole sight of attention despite one of the greatest visuals on screen, imagine a comparison between the bulls scene of BB2 and any scene of Kong and now stick ti your words. When a person says the budget of Kong makes its visuals look much better then a true person must shout out loud ' then why not a movie like Kong had this talk of town and nit an average movie like BB2' well our people don't accept because..., we are Regional Lovers and doubt mind a quality OTHER ! Only two things must clarify this review, either people are "" Frogs in well "" that we know only BB2 so we rate it this high, or they are illiterates, for after watching perfectly classic visual wonders still sticking to "" SAHO BB2 "" becz they understood nothing English !! I conclude saying PV SINDU had the 2nd place of badminton in Olympics recently but got the whole crappy hails and cores of money, while the 1st place Marin took her cash prize to continue life skilled life. I compare Sindu to BB2 and Marin to the really quality movies of west, in India !

Excellent!! Predictable yet it never disappointed me!!,"Hi, guys!! If you have not seen Bahubali 1 & 2 then I would recommend you to watch them now. U will miss the glory of an Indian epic movie if u don't watch it.

This review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. This is not a biased review.

Most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why Katappa killed Bahu Bali, is not a strong reason.

I think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. Or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie.

The reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. Sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. I don't want to spoil the story!!!

I'm a big fan of foreign movies(Hollywood and Korean) because they really make some sensible movies. I was never into Tollywood movies from the beginning. But, I have started watching movies from Tollywood recently and so far ""Bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to Telugu movies.

Reasons:

1. Forget about the VFX, I wasn't expecting much from an Indian movie since the budget is low. But, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and I was impressed by their work.

2. Movie Cast: Yes the cast is excellent, SSR is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. Each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. Even the Junior artists!!!

3. Each & every second that is related to the past is amazing.

4. Though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by SSR is amazing.

5. The movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil.

6. It teaches us ""What exactly the King is?""

7. It teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between King and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant.

8. High in morals, there are so many epic scenes. I don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. You will notice them anyhow.

9. There are situations in which Bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by Dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(Sivagami).

10. The movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. If you believe in yourself you can do anything. (Kumara Varma)

11. It tells us that ""in order to achieve good sometimes you need to do some sacrifices"".

I can write a few more but I'm running out of time I don't want u get bored of by my review.

There are some mistakes in this movie, I think most of the people would not notice them. You will find them in climax as well but who cares by the time you reach climax you will be impressed by the past of Amarendra Bahubali.

Dandalayya song is really awesome, it really suits our King(Prabahs).

The one who is giving a low rating to a movie just because of the mistakes, well I would like to tell them one thing:

""Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL the movie! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger(mistakes) or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!""","hi, guys!! if you have not seen bahubali 1 & 2 then i would recommend you to watch them now. u will miss the glory of an indian epic movie if u don't watch it. this review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. this is not a biased review. most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why katappa killed bahu bali, is not a strong reason. i think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie. the reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. i don't want to spoil the story!!! i'm a big fan of foreign movies(hollywood and korean) because they really make some sensible movies. i was never into tollywood movies from the beginning. but, i have started watching movies from tollywood recently and so far ""bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to telugu movies. reasons: 1. forget about the vfx, i wasn't expecting much from an indian movie since the budget is low. but, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and i was impressed by their work. 2. movie cast: yes the cast is excellent, ssr is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. even the junior artists!!! 3. each & every second that is related to the past is amazing. 4. though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by ssr is amazing. 5. the movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil. 6. it teaches us ""what exactly the king is?"" 7. it teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between king and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant. 8. high in morals, there are so many epic scenes. i don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. you will notice them anyhow. 9. there are situations in which bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(sivagami). 10. the movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. if you believe in yourself you can do anything.

Hastily made to milk the success of the predecessor,"Baahubali 2 (Conclusion) cannot be considered as just a normal movie, this is supposed to be the Epic conclusion of the biggest Non Hindi blockbuster ever.

Characters, premises are already established in Part 1, so this gives the makers full 2.38 hrs length of time to show the visual magic as expected from the Franchisee. we have to note that Part 1 was slickly edited and racy and mixed with the maximum amount of masala you can ever expect from an India movie, that too with technical perfection on par to Hollywood films

Given the time span of 2 years, given the budget in excess of 250 Crores and given the success of the Part 1, what we get to view is absolute trash. one should look through the visuals and try to think from makers view point. story is very predictable with no twists and turns, dialogues are too simple, penning the screenplay for this movie was an effortless job and doesn't require any imagination

again for the sake of family audience, female characters get more screen space and proceedings are similar to Indian mega serial at least during the first half of the movie Director has tried to keep the action fans happy by prolonging the climax war, which actually was a terribly wrong move, as the movie drags a lot during this period

What accounted for the huge success of Part 1, was its technical perfection and amount of detailing for outdoor and indoor locations, money spend on movie was well utilized and the richness shows on the screen.in the case of Part 2, it seems movie is made of shoe string budget. there are no longer vast locations which should have given the grandeur for the film, instead its easily recognizable even for an normal movie goer that the set design is below avg and CGI usage is terrible

Not so good is my opinion as I have respect for the Director and know his skills... but its a big let down for neutral fans like me... Baahubali 1 was superb and I enjoyed each frames esp after interval part... But in Baahubali 2, the starting and ending is just a big try but not at all good.. That does not means you should not check it out... Go to theaters and check yourself as opinions & likes may change as per person.

But please don't pay big for the movie.

"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is indeed the beginning of great cinema, Indian Cinema.","Movie: Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (UA)

Rating: 5/5

BAAHUBALI THE BEGINNING took entertainment and Indian cinema both to new heights. So obviously it raised the expectations from BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. And undoubtedly, the conclusion lives up to every expectation and proves to be rather better than the Beginning. Largely because here we have every good element needed for a perfect film, present in this film. I watched the film twice on the big screen. Such great films should be seen on the big screen and not on pirated prints.

BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is a perfect film which defines Indian cinema and culture. This isn't just a film, it's a grand celebration that must be celebrated at theatres. We don't get to see such great films daily. This film is really better than the Beginning because it offers more intensity, emotion, high voltage action, splendid visuals and goosebumps-inducing sequences. Even while watching it second time, I got goosebumps in certain sequences. This is really an unmissable family entertainer. There's no vulgarity or obscenity in this film. Kids can definitely watch and enjoy this film.

The best part of the film is...the entire film! I can't describe in words how entertaining this film is and it's really hard to choose only one or two scenes as favourite. SS Rajamouli proves himself yet again, along with his entire team. Every single character will be remembered in the history of Indian Cinema. Besides, there's a lot of creativity visible in BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. From the beginning to intermission to the end: each and every scene is 100% engaging and wonderfully shot. The action sequences are very enjoyable and perfectly executed. This is really the BEST action film ever, ever, ever.

The visuals are breathtaking. Splendid and presented with sharp details, the visual effects make you fall in love with the film. Prabhas is as entertaining and excellent as usual. Rana Daggubati is excellent in his role. As a character you'll hate him but as an actor you'll salute him. Anushka Shetty impresses big time. Sathyaraj...I mean what an actor! His performance is absolutely perfect. The music is really good and will stay with you for long. Cinematography too deserves a special mention for capturing this film in an excellent way. And how can one forget to praise the writer Vijayendra Prasad, who wrote this epic? Just praising won't do. A big salute!!!!!

Undoubtedly, BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is the best film of Indian Cinema. If you liked the beginning, you'll definitely like the conclusion. Even if you didn't, you'll love this part. And I loved both. The Conclusion however is, as I said before, better than the Beginning. Come on, now don't look at the negative reviews and watch this film in theatres with your family. And after watching it twice in theatre, I'm thinking about a third watch too...","movie: baahubali 2: the conclusion (ua) rating: 5/5 baahubali the beginning took entertainment and indian cinema both

Amazing Bahubalistic VFX Treat,"I am not going to start my review with the most discussed topic ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali"" as this is just a small footnote in this magnum opus. There is much more to the film than just this .Many of you won't believe me, but trust me, I have watched it and can vouch for it !!

The Plot: The story continues from where it left off in Part one. The heir to the throne of the mighty Mahishmati empire, prince Amarendra Bahubali (Prabhas) along with Katappa ( Sathyaraj) are sent on a covert mission to mix with the subjects and get to know them better. During their travels Bahubali meets Devsena ( Anushka Shetty) , princess of Kuntal Rajya and falls in love with her. Unknown to him BhallalDeva ( Duggubati) along with his father ( Nassar) are busy planning Bahubali's downfall .They succeed in doing so by creating a misunderstanding between his godmother Sivagami(Ramya) and prevent him from ascending the throne . Ballaldeva is instead made king and along with his scheming father forces Bahubali out of the palace. Amerandra Bahubali meets a tragic end at the hands of his mentor Katappa (won't reveal the plot or I will be roasted alive by die hard fans who still haven't read about it on the WhatsApp messages going viral !!).

The rest of the story focuses on the present where Bahubali's son, Mahendra joins hands with evergreen Katappa ( Omg !! the guy is still alive and kicking after all this while .. a true Bhishma Pitamaha of the story !!) to fight the antagonist BhallalDeva, avenge his fathers death and finally regain the throne of Maheshmati.

The story is nothing new  we all knew how it would end all hunky dory . Everyone goes home happy happy!!

Cast: The Protagonist / Antagonist duo Prabhas and Duggubati are well matched adversaries and the climax is a visual treat even though it has been stretched a bit. Prabhas done a great job and has a lot of ""seeti bajao"" moments throughout the film especially the one when he mount an elephant by stepping on its trunk.We know that it is all VFX but yet enjoy and savor the moment.

Nassar as Bhallaldeva's father is nice with a Shakuni mama kind of look to his character.Again, VFX used to create his crippled arm is amazing !!

Anushkha Shetty as the feisty Devsena and Ramya as Sivagami , the de-facto ruler of Mahishmati have very strong and well etched out characters . Their confrontation scenes hold you in awe and steal the thunder from their male counterparts. A rare achievement not often seen in Indian cinema!! Tammanna, unfortunately doesn't have anything much and is seen only in a handful of scenes .

Why you should watch it on the big screen only: It is very rare that you get to see an Indian movie laden with such amazing special effects. It gives an Amar Chitra Katha type of feel to the whole story which indeed refreshing. The whole look is pleasing to the eye with innovative action scenes, awesome costumes and lavish sets . I loved the movie  total paisa vasool even though it is far far away from reality but then that's how Indian films are supposed to be  aren't they !!!!

Go watch it and enjoy the glory of Bahubali unfold !!","i am not going to start my review with the most discussed topic ""why katappa killed bahubali"" as this is just a small footnote in this magnum

Fewer risks taken and still devoid of cynicism. This is still a piece of great cinema,"In anticipation of this movie, I organised a screening of the 2015 magnum opus for friends at my humble abode and I can safely proclaim that everyone enjoyed it. There are some movies which are not meant to be enjoyed alone; the spontaneous uproarious unbridled fist-pumping reactions of an audience drive up the enjoyment of the movie to a whole new level. Baahubali: The Beginning is that type of movie. With the right mindset and an adventurous spirit, the movie can open a door into a whole new world of cinematic pleasure.

Baahubali: The Beginning literally ends with a jaw-dropping cliffhanger that matches the driving ambition of the narrative. For more than a year, I was thinking about how S.S. Rajamouli would explain the ending and after watching Baahubali 2: The Conclusion I was not only more than satisfied, I was stunned out of my senses. Putting both movies together, I can now clearly see that part 1 is just a world-building and character set-up appetiser, the scrumptious main dish and delectable dessert are all in the sequel. What a blast! That's it! Review is done! Go buy a ticket already!

Still here? Okay let me drop a few more paragraphs

Baahabuli 2 takes us back to the kingdom of Mahishmati and puts a spotlight on the feud between Baahubali (Prabhas) and Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati). Will Shiva, the son of Baahubali, succeed against the tyrannical and treacherous Bhallala Deva? Will he regain authority of the kingdom that was snatched from his family by Bhallala Deva? Why did Bhallala Deva keep Devasena (Anushka Shetty) captive all these years? Why is Sivagami so determined to save the baby that she literally drowned standing up in a torrent of on- rushing water? Finally, the million-dollar question that was literally the final frame of Baahubali 1 is answered.

S.S. Rajamouli's method of upping the ante for the sequel is the typical ""more is better"" approach, but he takes it much further. The visual opulence is astonishing, the kaleidoscope of colours awe-inspiring, the humongous sets jaw-dropping and the costumes resplendent beyond my wildest dreams. Every frame is meticulously crafted. Every detail and stylistic serve the narrative. He clearly understands what made the first movie so well-loved and we are given not one, not two, but three battles involving huge armies. But kudos to him for not making the battles feel repetitive by underscoring them with different stakes and fighting methods. The last one involving tall trees and human catapults is so inventive. I have seen hundreds of battles on the big screen, but I have never seen what was depicted here.

Just like the earlier movie, this one reinvents its own rules and is totally devoid of cynicism. Comparing with the first film, Rajamouli takes fewer risks in this outing, but the narrative is still joyous and filled with court intrigue, family drama and deadly double-crosses. The characters may be the size of mountains, but they are flawed human beings with weaknesses that are absolutely cathartic. Yes, I know the main caveat on most people's mouth is that it is way over the top. But for this armchair movie buff and part-time critic, the storytelling is so compelling, the characters so larger than life, the love story so affecting and the energy so propulsive that I didn't mind swimming in the sheer excess. Heck! Baahubali is meant to leap across a 50-metre abyss, catapult 100 metres over walls and he is a way better than archer than Legolas! I believe everything!

I apologise for the excessive use of exclamation marks but this movie earns them, and please allow me to drop a few more. This is frigging cinema! This is the reason I love going to the theatres and once in a while I love getting totally stoned out of my senses with the possibilities of cinema!","in anticipation of this movie, i organised a

The last nail in the coffin,,,,,,,[],,
Finally the wait is over .... And my wait was worthful,"It can't be wrong to proclaim that ""Bahubali 2"" was the movie for which almost every section of the Indian Society was waiting.

This is really a first South Indian movie which has created a strong buzz in North India. It is really a pride to see that Indian Cinema can also produce some high budget flicks and can give us some entertainment. I was feeling really proud that I am watching an Indian Movie which is competing Hollywood.

S S Rajamouli really deserves praise from all over India for his exceptional work. Investing 5 years in just two movies is not a joke. But he handled it very smoothly and also the acting of the star cast made this movie a watchable drama. Despite of its lengthy duration.

Story wise it was brilliantly handled by Vijendra Prasad ; Performance wise almost everyone was good ; War sequences were good though some of them were unrealistic ; Heroism scenes were responsible to stick the audience to there seats.

Over all Movie is a visual treat and almost every Indian or foreigner should go watch this movie and witness the great Indian Hindu culture and the glory of Hindu kings as well as Indian cinema.

My rating is 7.9/10.","it can't be wrong to proclaim that ""bahubali 2"" was the movie for which almost every section of the indian society was waiting. this is really a first south indian movie which has created a strong buzz in north india. it is really a pride to see that indian cinema can also produce some high budget flicks and can give us some entertainment. i was feeling really proud that i am watching an indian movie which is competing hollywood. s s rajamouli really deserves praise from all over india for his exceptional work. investing 5 years in just two movies is not a joke. but he handled it very smoothly and also the acting of the star cast made this movie a watchable drama. despite of its lengthy duration. story wise it was brilliantly handled by vijendra prasad ;

MUST WATCH - Exceeds the Magnanimity of Bahubali 1,,,,,,,[],,
OK OK Movie,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I Disappointed for this movie.","if this the best epic indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. sure. it's a huge project. the sets are great. the graphics/cgi are

Why so much hatred?,,,,,,,[],,
An emotional and sensational epic worth a billion views,"Normally in India many directors make a romantic hit and create a lot of fuss about it in the media, just to attract viewers. But Bahubali 2: The Conclusion is above class. It covers every type of viewer, It provides a few minutes of romance mixed with pride and valor. To be honest many times I got tear in my eyes after viewing some of emotional scenes in the movie. It will touch your heart no matter to which age group you belong and whatever gender you are.

I bet everyone will find something for them in this movie to appreciate. This movie have War, courage, style, comedy, drama and mystery everything in it. Prabhas and Daggubati both worked outstanding and the turned themselves immensely into the character. The chemistry of Anuska and Prabhas is so appealing. I'll say this sequel of Bahubali is even better than main movie. Sound and graphics used in movie is just superb. So I would like to give it a 10/10","normally in india many directors make a romantic hit and create a lot of fuss about it in the media, just to attract viewers. but bahubali 2: the conclusion is

I enjoyed this movie,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.",baahubali 2  the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline  but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes  interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects  colorful and exciting  it is also exhilarating  though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story  but above all else  both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters ,"baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film visually dazzling behold great costumes, interiors phenomenal set pieces special effects. colorful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film usually dazzling behold great costumes, interior phenomena set pieces special effects. colourful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","['baahubali', '2', 'conclusion', 'quite', 'good', 'predecessor', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'storyline', 'film', 'usually', 'dazzling', 'behold', 'great', 'costumes', 'interior', 'phenomena', 'set', 'pieces', 'special', 'effects', 'colourful', 'exciting', 'also', 'exhilarating', 'though', 'silly', 'action', 'thus', 'succeeds', 'pretty', 'good', 'conclusion', 'story', 'else', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'incredibly', 'epic', 'scope', 'world', 'building', 'aspect', 'much', 'better', 'american', 'blockbusters']",baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomena set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori els film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust,baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomenon set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori el film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust

EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts. The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly! During the first quarter the film can be boring to some people , they stretched here a little bit as bahubali goes to find his love. There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there.

A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,,,,,,,[],,
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.

People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.

When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.

Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.

It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.

1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.

2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.

3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.

Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.","why so much hatred on this movie. i wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. i'm surprised not even

An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.

The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.

The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.

The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.

A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.

The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.

Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.

Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.

Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__","'baahubali -

typical masala trash,,,,,,,[],,
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. in the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. in the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences indian movies have ever seen. the songs are not that appealing but okay. overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. so don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how indian movies have gone to a whole new level. i am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known;

Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.

Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.

Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.

Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.

Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.

Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.

Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.

Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.

Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it.","bahubali : the conclusion review - a film which has taken audience anticipation to next level finally released today and

Expectations soiled,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.

Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbelief

Exp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skills

Exp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retribution

Exp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wasted

Exp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a week

All in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.

Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.

However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'.","yes, the movie

Hilarious piece of Junk,,,,,,,[],,
one can sleep after while,,,,,,,[],,
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.

Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.

In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.

Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics.","i really liked baahubali the beginning. though it was not great,it was a good movie. now the second

Don't waste your money or time in this awful movie,,,,,,,[],,
Baahubali 2 is a film that will be remembered across decades,"A strong story line built upon the enriches of Indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. We have a very strong cultural background of Vedas, Puranas and the great mythological epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. I grew up reading these big epics and after so many years I witnessed an epic film - 'Baahubali - A Man with strong arms'. I celebrated this Indian Magnum Opus just like the way I have celebrated all time great blockbusters in Hollywood and Bollywood.

If we can accept the great stories like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings trilogy, the famous Game of thrones series (which has its own heroes following the same dharma - righteous path to combat evil), then we shall also celebrate Baahubali too. SS Rajamouli - (Director) had made sure that we have enough heroic personalities and larger than life characters in our own mythological epic stories. There are many reasons to celebrate the humongous Baahubali 2 too.

Baahubali 2 is not about box office numbers, it is a story which has managed to unite entire India irrespective of state, language, film industry based on a simple question - 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali'?, it is most certain that the direction, power of narration and screenplay has created an impact and liking towards the film. Don't forget, Baahubali 1 - The Beginning had laid the initial footprint two years ago and the first part of the movie was not forgotten.

Baahubali 2 rides on the momentum from where the first part has left. It has it's own filmy moments that deliver goosebumps to the viewers and the famous fight scenes that galore within itself. Claps thud, whistles blow, shouts from the viewers during several moments which cannot be expressed in words. It is a film which doesn't rely solely on VFX, thought it has been touted as the best film with extraordinary visuals. It doesn't disappoint the viewers and the execution was strong enough to make a visual impact.

Baahubali is our own Indian super hero who follows the simple righteous path of Dharma and character is well sculpted. Emphasis is thoroughly laid on every finer detail in the film. Devasena and Sivagami are the two most powerful women characters which one can see in recent times. Bhalaladeva looks intimidatingly venomous through his expressions. Kattappa's is always the go to warrior who bows his head to the King.

Background score of this film has been excellent and it keeps the audience enthralled and entertained. Baahubali's character and it's powerful screen presence gets elevated with magnificent BGM.

Baahubali, undoubtedly is a proud Indian film that broke barriers, it has proved that with a strong subject and excellent directional execution one can reach the sky. Eventually, it is the character Baahubali himself that prevails in every viewer's mind and imagination.

The world wide appreciation as reported from top news channels such as Guardian, Wall street Journal etc has been remarkable. It has set a new benchmark in the Indian film industry and it is striking the doors of Hollywood as it already turned down the some of the newly released Hollywood blockbusters in terms of Box-office collections.

Instead of criticizing the film and finding out flaws in CGI, Indians should stand up and applaud 'Baahubali' for it's impact and contribution to Indian cinema.

My rating is 10/10 and it has been an unbelievable experience watching it on big screen. It is flawless and I take a bow to the hard work put in by the entire cast and crew of the film. It teaches us the sole aspect of belief and execution. SS Rajamouli believed in the subject(Bahubali) with lot of conviction, he braved the odds and he breathed fire and life into it.

The result, we can see everywhere.....thanks to the story teller himself. Baahubali will be remembered across decades and it lives on.....","a strong story line built upon the enriches of indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. we have a very strong cultural background of vedas, puranas and the great mythological epics like ramayana and mahabharata. i grew up reading these big epics and after so many years i witnessed an epic film - 'baahubali -

who says this movie got remarkable vfx graphics?,,,,,,,[],,
An Indian Epic... in true sense of the word!,"Let me begin by saying I was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first half and it didn't feel forced. This movie will grab your attention from the introductory scene (goosebumps worthy) till almost the entire length of the film. It has a high energy throughout and a lot of credit for that goes to the grand visuals along with exceptional acting from all actors, especially Ramya as Shivagami and Prabhas as Amarendra Baahubali.

For me, the most powerful sequence comes in the middle of the movie, this is our GoT moment and this one sequence alone shows the potential of Indian Cinema, you will know what I am talking about once you watch the movie. Another amazing yet subtle thing to notice is how Prabhas has played two different characters, the calm, experienced demeanor of Amarendra Baahubali and the rough- edged, not-groomed persona of Mahendra Baahubali. Kudos to him.

You will notice some over the top action sequences where S. S. Rajamouli has taken liberty to show us fresh imaginative action which adds to the fun factor. The movie does die down towards the end, however that is bound to happen considering the fact that it was adrenaline-pumping for so long.

It takes great directorial vision and deep pockets of producers to make this happen and hopefully the success of this film triggers the rise of more such epics that we can enjoy. This is a must watch. Just the sheer scale of visual effects and production value is breath-taking, no one should miss this.","let me begin by saying i was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first

(goosebumps worthy) till almost the entire length of the film. it has a high energy throughout and a lot of credit for that goes to the grand visuals along with exceptional acting from all actors, especially ramya as shivagami and prabhas as amarendra baahubali. for me, the most powerful sequence comes in the middle of the movie, this is our got moment and this one sequence alone shows the potential of indian cinema, you will know what i am talking about once you watch the movie. another amazing yet subtle thing to notice is how prabhas has played two different characters, the calm,

Baahubali -The GOAT,"=====SPOILER FREE====

#BAAHUBALI2 is the best film that has ever been made in Indian cinema and considering the amount of emotions that are attached with this film, it is sure to rank among the classics this world has ever produced.India is blessed to have directors like Rajamouli.His creativity and imagination is beyond comparison.He simply brought the best out of all the characters, all the actors.I haven't seen such VFX's, such cinematography, such screenplay anywhere else.

Coming to acting all the actors have delivered career defining performances be it RANA,ANUSHKA,SATHYARAJ,RAMYA,TAMANNA(for the first part) but the man who has simply changed the rules of the game is PRABHAS. There is a certain kind of royalty that is attached to him yet it is his humane nature that makes him absolutely endearing.What an actor!!!He is the definition of what a Superstar is.

VERDICT-Overall Bollywood will never have the balls to make a film like this ever because films like these require passion, commitment, patience and creativity that Bollywood lacks.MAHABHARATA can only be made by RAJAMOULI and nobody else. BAAHUBALI is a phenomenon that will easily earn a minimum of 1000cr.Nothing can best it in the near future.It is a classic that will be foretold to future generation as the ""Movie of this generation"". Go experience this once in a lifetime event.

RATING-This film can't be rated because of its super humanness, magnanimity and grandeur.You have to see it to believe it.","=====spoiler free==== #baahubali2 is the best film that has ever been made

A nonstop and immersive entertainment !!,"The wait is over, Rajamouli and his crew did it again, 2 hr 47 min nonstop and immersive entertainment.

It is simply another visual wonder, didn't realize when it was over. The style of storytelling was excellent, thought it was bit of slow in the beginning, but slowly it picked up and never looked back. Cinematography, natural landscape, settings and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, a visual journey through the Mahishmati and Kunthala Samrajyam. Also with great performances not only by Prabhas and Rana but equally everyone, Nazar was exceptional and in fact he stole the show.

All my stars go towards the story, beautiful picturization, production value and performances. All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge between two brothers but more like an epic to the intuitive beauty of visual effects. It provides an extremely fascinating and touching experience to those who have an affinity for the mythological stories, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of modern filmmaking for cinema lovers. It's a perfect movie, a film likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. Baahubali – The Conclusion' is visual poetry of the most ancient kind background sceneries, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. Last but not the least, this is equally (if not superior) in par with Baahubali 1.

Good story that should've been spared from cartoonish visual extravaganza!,"First of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. Like many such movies, it had those wow moments with CGI but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. Last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. It had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.","first of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. like many such movies, it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.","first of all, not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film, it was an entertaining film from the story perspective. like many such movies, it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war/fight sequences or the animals. last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise. it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out.",first of all  not taking away any credit from the makers and actors of the film  it was an entertaining film from the story perspective  like many such movies  it had those wow moments with cgi but overall it disappoints with the cartoonish portrayal of the war fight sequences or the animals  last half an hour of the movie was the most ludicrous part in the entire movie franchise  it had so much potential to be something else than how it turned out ,"first all, taking away credit makers actors film, entertaining film story perspective. like many movies, wow moments cgi overall disappoints cartoonish portrayal war/fight sequences animals. last half hour movie ludicrous part entire movie franchise. much potential something else turned out.","first all, taking away credit makers actors film, entertaining film story perspective. like many moves, now moments chi overall disappoints cartoons portray war/fight sequence animals. last half hour movie ludicrous part entire movie franchise. much potential something else turned out.","['first', 'all', 'taking', 'away', 'credit', 'makers', 'actors', 'film', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'perspective', 'like', 'many', 'moves', 'now', 'moments', 'chi', 'overall', 'disappoints', 'cartoons', 'portray', 'war/fight', 'sequence', 'animals', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'ludicrous', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'franchise', 'much', 'potential', 'something', 'else', 'turned', 'out']",first all take away credit maker actor film entertain film stori perspect like mani move now moment chi overal disappoint cartoon portray war/fight sequenc anim last half hour movi ludicr part entir movi franchis much potenti someth els turn out,first all take away credit maker actor film entertain film stori perspect like mani move now moment chi overal disappoint cartoon portray war/fight sequenc anim last half hour movi ludicr part entir movi franchis much potenti someth el turn out
Over-hyped with very bad VFX,"What is all the hype about? story is like a typical saas-bahu drama and the VFX sucked. I loved the first one, but this one left me disappointed and how. With such a massive budget they could have made something way better than what was delivered. I guess the critics just went with the hype and gave it good ratings. A lot of unreal sequences that make you laugh at some points, (how does a person get on fire and not burn?). If some of these sequences were in a bollywood film, critics and audiences would've trolled it and given the film bad ratings, then why not for this? i'm shocked at why this film earned so much, maybe cause tickets were priced higher than other movies. overall it's just an Over-hyped movie. don't waste money on it. there are better films way better than this which go unnoticed because of low budgets. just because this movie has earned so much it doesn't make it the best.","what is all the hype about?

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic,"Why Kattapa.. Why?? A question probably 1.4+ billion people have been quizzed about for the past 2 years.. Well, I assure you, the wait for that answer was worth more than the stunts, songs or a budget of 2.5 billion INR.. It probably was a combination of one of the most emotionally and frustratingly epic scene I've ever witnessed in Indian cinema.. Just the grandeur of that one scene gave for some goosebumps; for some a prolonged tear jerker; and for some absolute silence with awe.

The Conclusion is helmed on 5 shoulders.. #Prabhas, #Sathyaraj, #RanaDaggubati, #AnushkaShetty and #RamyaKrishan, who have all done their parts well. But the strength of the movie is Prabhas who literally lived the character. The support cast have all done their parts brilliantly.

3 hours 15 minutes: Having watched it in Bahrain, I was surrounded with the thrill of sitting in a cinema in India; whistles, claps and howls of joy; every scene was celebrated.

This movie had a good mix of soulful songs, witty one liners, amazing sound effects, bgm, beautiful locations (both original and visually created), grand sets, hard hitting stunts and touching moments placed aptly.

I had read earlier that the VFX is in par with #TheLordOfTheRings and #HarryPotter.. I would say it is top notch for Indian cinema.

Although I did not understand a word, I watched this movie in the language it was conceived - Telugu. Wanted to keep it as original as possible. It was a challenge coordinating the scene with the subs, but if I'm still recommending it, you must understand how good this movie must have been.

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic.. A theatrical must watch for all.. #Enjoy

First time in 26 years of my life I am writing a review,,,,,,,[],,
Nice Conclusion,"‌Bahubali 2 - Nice movie. Finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of Kattappa's betrayal. Movie is a larger than life sequel of the Rise and Fall and again rise of Amrendra Bahubali. Story is good, Special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). Story starts with a quick recap of the first part. Runs with the love story of Bahubali-Devsena, what led to the sacrifice of Sivagami, murder of Bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. Prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. Anushka is good as a Princess and matched well with Prabhas. Rana is Badly good as the previous one. Both Ramaiya and Naseer did well in their respective roles. Tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. Special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(I thought I'm watching a Hercules movie, LOL). Bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. Even after all this, still there is some disappointment (I don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). Movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'Katappa Killed Bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 - nice movie. finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of kattappa's betrayal. movie is a larger than life sequel of the rise and fall and again rise of amrendra bahubali. story is good, special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). story starts with a quick recap of the first part. runs with the love story of bahubali-devsena, what led to the sacrifice of sivagami, murder of bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. anushka is good as a princess and matched well with prabhas. rana is badly good as the previous one. both ramaiya and naseer did well in their respective roles. tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(i thought i'm watching a hercules movie, lol). bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. even after all this, still there is some disappointment (i don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'katappa killed bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 -

"Average Movie, Insane Audience !","Well we are Indians and we haven't seen an Indian film grossing this sums any time. Is it really worth of crossing 1000 cores mark ??, I may be insane according to many in saying the movie is never a perfect war flick but just a documentary in mixture of Indian sentiments, romantic scenes, immature graphics, loud BM audience elevation scenes and all in all a commercial, nearly 3hours business package, which in the name of REGIONAL PATRIOTISM people poured money tearing their pockets, in lack of genuine judgment. I wonder had any Indian director made a movie like Gladiator, that had a perfect Royal story of unique kind, or had made a movie Titanic, that hit screens way back 1997, it is not a brow rising movement for us, as there would have been temples for the directors. Imagine the graphic content of Harry potter, the very beginner of the series in 2000, can you compare the quality to this great BB2 of 2017 wid17yrs of technology ahead..., and still our people hail it saying THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR BB2, my word !!, the Gods of insanity dancing on our heads. A genuine person of my kind ( I believe so ) should say, should the "" Y "" factor of BB1, (I mean y the man killed the other) carry this huge mess of talk ?? I don't understand, with this kind of technology on update and thousands of movies available, is it this BB2 that should have a bhajan in many parts of modern India. Y not ""Kong"" grab d whole sight of attention despite one of the greatest visuals on screen, imagine a comparison between the bulls scene of BB2 and any scene of Kong and now stick ti your words. When a person says the budget of Kong makes its visuals look much better then a true person must shout out loud ' then why not a movie like Kong had this talk of town and nit an average movie like BB2' well our people don't accept because..., we are Regional Lovers and doubt mind a quality OTHER ! Only two things must clarify this review, either people are "" Frogs in well "" that we know only BB2 so we rate it this high, or they are illiterates, for after watching perfectly classic visual wonders still sticking to "" SAHO BB2 "" becz they understood nothing English !! I conclude saying PV SINDU had the 2nd place of badminton in Olympics recently but got the whole crappy hails and cores of money, while the 1st place Marin took her cash prize to continue life skilled life. I compare Sindu to BB2 and Marin to the really quality movies of west, in India !

Excellent!! Predictable yet it never disappointed me!!,"Hi, guys!! If you have not seen Bahubali 1 & 2 then I would recommend you to watch them now. U will miss the glory of an Indian epic movie if u don't watch it.

This review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. This is not a biased review.

Most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why Katappa killed Bahu Bali, is not a strong reason.

I think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. Or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie.

The reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. Sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. I don't want to spoil the story!!!

I'm a big fan of foreign movies(Hollywood and Korean) because they really make some sensible movies. I was never into Tollywood movies from the beginning. But, I have started watching movies from Tollywood recently and so far ""Bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to Telugu movies.

Reasons:

1. Forget about the VFX, I wasn't expecting much from an Indian movie since the budget is low. But, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and I was impressed by their work.

2. Movie Cast: Yes the cast is excellent, SSR is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. Each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. Even the Junior artists!!!

3. Each & every second that is related to the past is amazing.

4. Though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by SSR is amazing.

5. The movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil.

6. It teaches us ""What exactly the King is?""

7. It teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between King and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant.

8. High in morals, there are so many epic scenes. I don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. You will notice them anyhow.

9. There are situations in which Bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by Dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(Sivagami).

10. The movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. If you believe in yourself you can do anything. (Kumara Varma)

11. It tells us that ""in order to achieve good sometimes you need to do some sacrifices"".

I can write a few more but I'm running out of time I don't want u get bored of by my review.

There are some mistakes in this movie, I think most of the people would not notice them. You will find them in climax as well but who cares by the time you reach climax you will be impressed by the past of Amarendra Bahubali.

Dandalayya song is really awesome, it really suits our King(Prabahs).

The one who is giving a low rating to a movie just because of the mistakes, well I would like to tell them one thing:

""Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL the movie! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger(mistakes) or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!""","hi, guys!! if you have not seen bahubali 1 & 2 then i would recommend you to watch them now. u will miss the glory of an indian epic movie if u don't watch it. this review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. this is not a biased review. most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why katappa killed bahu bali, is not a strong reason. i think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie. the reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. i don't want to spoil the story!!! i'm a big fan of foreign movies(hollywood and korean) because they really make some sensible movies. i was never into tollywood movies from the beginning. but, i have started watching movies from tollywood recently and so far ""bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to telugu movies. reasons: 1. forget about the vfx, i wasn't expecting much from an indian movie since the budget is low. but, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and i was impressed by their work. 2. movie cast: yes the cast is excellent, ssr is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. even the junior artists!!! 3. each & every second that is related to the past is amazing. 4. though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by ssr is amazing. 5. the movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil. 6. it teaches us ""what exactly the king is?"" 7. it teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between king and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant. 8. high in morals, there are so many epic scenes. i don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. you will notice them anyhow. 9. there are situations in which bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(sivagami). 10. the movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. if you believe in yourself you can do anything.

Hastily made to milk the success of the predecessor,"Baahubali 2 (Conclusion) cannot be considered as just a normal movie, this is supposed to be the Epic conclusion of the biggest Non Hindi blockbuster ever.

Characters, premises are already established in Part 1, so this gives the makers full 2.38 hrs length of time to show the visual magic as expected from the Franchisee. we have to note that Part 1 was slickly edited and racy and mixed with the maximum amount of masala you can ever expect from an India movie, that too with technical perfection on par to Hollywood films

Given the time span of 2 years, given the budget in excess of 250 Crores and given the success of the Part 1, what we get to view is absolute trash. one should look through the visuals and try to think from makers view point. story is very predictable with no twists and turns, dialogues are too simple, penning the screenplay for this movie was an effortless job and doesn't require any imagination

again for the sake of family audience, female characters get more screen space and proceedings are similar to Indian mega serial at least during the first half of the movie Director has tried to keep the action fans happy by prolonging the climax war, which actually was a terribly wrong move, as the movie drags a lot during this period

What accounted for the huge success of Part 1, was its technical perfection and amount of detailing for outdoor and indoor locations, money spend on movie was well utilized and the richness shows on the screen.in the case of Part 2, it seems movie is made of shoe string budget. there are no longer vast locations which should have given the grandeur for the film, instead its easily recognizable even for an normal movie goer that the set design is below avg and CGI usage is terrible

Not so good is my opinion as I have respect for the Director and know his skills... but its a big let down for neutral fans like me... Baahubali 1 was superb and I enjoyed each frames esp after interval part... But in Baahubali 2, the starting and ending is just a big try but not at all good.. That does not means you should not check it out... Go to theaters and check yourself as opinions & likes may change as per person.

But please don't pay big for the movie.

"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is indeed the beginning of great cinema, Indian Cinema.","Movie: Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (UA)

Rating: 5/5

BAAHUBALI THE BEGINNING took entertainment and Indian cinema both to new heights. So obviously it raised the expectations from BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. And undoubtedly, the conclusion lives up to every expectation and proves to be rather better than the Beginning. Largely because here we have every good element needed for a perfect film, present in this film. I watched the film twice on the big screen. Such great films should be seen on the big screen and not on pirated prints.

BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is a perfect film which defines Indian cinema and culture. This isn't just a film, it's a grand celebration that must be celebrated at theatres. We don't get to see such great films daily. This film is really better than the Beginning because it offers more intensity, emotion, high voltage action, splendid visuals and goosebumps-inducing sequences. Even while watching it second time, I got goosebumps in certain sequences. This is really an unmissable family entertainer. There's no vulgarity or obscenity in this film. Kids can definitely watch and enjoy this film.

The best part of the film is...the entire film! I can't describe in words how entertaining this film is and it's really hard to choose only one or two scenes as favourite. SS Rajamouli proves himself yet again, along with his entire team. Every single character will be remembered in the history of Indian Cinema. Besides, there's a lot of creativity visible in BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. From the beginning to intermission to the end: each and every scene is 100% engaging and wonderfully shot. The action sequences are very enjoyable and perfectly executed. This is really the BEST action film ever, ever, ever.

The visuals are breathtaking. Splendid and presented with sharp details, the visual effects make you fall in love with the film. Prabhas is as entertaining and excellent as usual. Rana Daggubati is excellent in his role. As a character you'll hate him but as an actor you'll salute him. Anushka Shetty impresses big time. Sathyaraj...I mean what an actor! His performance is absolutely perfect. The music is really good and will stay with you for long. Cinematography too deserves a special mention for capturing this film in an excellent way. And how can one forget to praise the writer Vijayendra Prasad, who wrote this epic? Just praising won't do. A big salute!!!!!

Undoubtedly, BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is the best film of Indian Cinema. If you liked the beginning, you'll definitely like the conclusion. Even if you didn't, you'll love this part. And I loved both. The Conclusion however is, as I said before, better than the Beginning. Come on, now don't look at the negative reviews and watch this film in theatres with your family. And after watching it twice in theatre, I'm thinking about a third watch too...","movie: baahubali 2: the conclusion (ua) rating: 5/5 baahubali the beginning took entertainment and indian cinema both

Amazing Bahubalistic VFX Treat,"I am not going to start my review with the most discussed topic ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali"" as this is just a small footnote in this magnum opus. There is much more to the film than just this .Many of you won't believe me, but trust me, I have watched it and can vouch for it !!

The Plot: The story continues from where it left off in Part one. The heir to the throne of the mighty Mahishmati empire, prince Amarendra Bahubali (Prabhas) along with Katappa ( Sathyaraj) are sent on a covert mission to mix with the subjects and get to know them better. During their travels Bahubali meets Devsena ( Anushka Shetty) , princess of Kuntal Rajya and falls in love with her. Unknown to him BhallalDeva ( Duggubati) along with his father ( Nassar) are busy planning Bahubali's downfall .They succeed in doing so by creating a misunderstanding between his godmother Sivagami(Ramya) and prevent him from ascending the throne . Ballaldeva is instead made king and along with his scheming father forces Bahubali out of the palace. Amerandra Bahubali meets a tragic end at the hands of his mentor Katappa (won't reveal the plot or I will be roasted alive by die hard fans who still haven't read about it on the WhatsApp messages going viral !!).

The rest of the story focuses on the present where Bahubali's son, Mahendra joins hands with evergreen Katappa ( Omg !! the guy is still alive and kicking after all this while .. a true Bhishma Pitamaha of the story !!) to fight the antagonist BhallalDeva, avenge his fathers death and finally regain the throne of Maheshmati.

The story is nothing new  we all knew how it would end all hunky dory . Everyone goes home happy happy!!

Cast: The Protagonist / Antagonist duo Prabhas and Duggubati are well matched adversaries and the climax is a visual treat even though it has been stretched a bit. Prabhas done a great job and has a lot of ""seeti bajao"" moments throughout the film especially the one when he mount an elephant by stepping on its trunk.We know that it is all VFX but yet enjoy and savor the moment.

Nassar as Bhallaldeva's father is nice with a Shakuni mama kind of look to his character.Again, VFX used to create his crippled arm is amazing !!

Anushkha Shetty as the feisty Devsena and Ramya as Sivagami , the de-facto ruler of Mahishmati have very strong and well etched out characters . Their confrontation scenes hold you in awe and steal the thunder from their male counterparts. A rare achievement not often seen in Indian cinema!! Tammanna, unfortunately doesn't have anything much and is seen only in a handful of scenes .

Why you should watch it on the big screen only: It is very rare that you get to see an Indian movie laden with such amazing special effects. It gives an Amar Chitra Katha type of feel to the whole story which indeed refreshing. The whole look is pleasing to the eye with innovative action scenes, awesome costumes and lavish sets . I loved the movie  total paisa vasool even though it is far far away from reality but then that's how Indian films are supposed to be  aren't they !!!!

Go watch it and enjoy the glory of Bahubali unfold !!","i am not going to start my review with the most discussed topic ""why katappa killed bahubali"" as this is just a small footnote in this magnum

Fewer risks taken and still devoid of cynicism. This is still a piece of great cinema,"In anticipation of this movie, I organised a screening of the 2015 magnum opus for friends at my humble abode and I can safely proclaim that everyone enjoyed it. There are some movies which are not meant to be enjoyed alone; the spontaneous uproarious unbridled fist-pumping reactions of an audience drive up the enjoyment of the movie to a whole new level. Baahubali: The Beginning is that type of movie. With the right mindset and an adventurous spirit, the movie can open a door into a whole new world of cinematic pleasure.

Baahubali: The Beginning literally ends with a jaw-dropping cliffhanger that matches the driving ambition of the narrative. For more than a year, I was thinking about how S.S. Rajamouli would explain the ending and after watching Baahubali 2: The Conclusion I was not only more than satisfied, I was stunned out of my senses. Putting both movies together, I can now clearly see that part 1 is just a world-building and character set-up appetiser, the scrumptious main dish and delectable dessert are all in the sequel. What a blast! That's it! Review is done! Go buy a ticket already!

Still here? Okay let me drop a few more paragraphs

Baahabuli 2 takes us back to the kingdom of Mahishmati and puts a spotlight on the feud between Baahubali (Prabhas) and Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati). Will Shiva, the son of Baahubali, succeed against the tyrannical and treacherous Bhallala Deva? Will he regain authority of the kingdom that was snatched from his family by Bhallala Deva? Why did Bhallala Deva keep Devasena (Anushka Shetty) captive all these years? Why is Sivagami so determined to save the baby that she literally drowned standing up in a torrent of on- rushing water? Finally, the million-dollar question that was literally the final frame of Baahubali 1 is answered.

S.S. Rajamouli's method of upping the ante for the sequel is the typical ""more is better"" approach, but he takes it much further. The visual opulence is astonishing, the kaleidoscope of colours awe-inspiring, the humongous sets jaw-dropping and the costumes resplendent beyond my wildest dreams. Every frame is meticulously crafted. Every detail and stylistic serve the narrative. He clearly understands what made the first movie so well-loved and we are given not one, not two, but three battles involving huge armies. But kudos to him for not making the battles feel repetitive by underscoring them with different stakes and fighting methods. The last one involving tall trees and human catapults is so inventive. I have seen hundreds of battles on the big screen, but I have never seen what was depicted here.

Just like the earlier movie, this one reinvents its own rules and is totally devoid of cynicism. Comparing with the first film, Rajamouli takes fewer risks in this outing, but the narrative is still joyous and filled with court intrigue, family drama and deadly double-crosses. The characters may be the size of mountains, but they are flawed human beings with weaknesses that are absolutely cathartic. Yes, I know the main caveat on most people's mouth is that it is way over the top. But for this armchair movie buff and part-time critic, the storytelling is so compelling, the characters so larger than life, the love story so affecting and the energy so propulsive that I didn't mind swimming in the sheer excess. Heck! Baahubali is meant to leap across a 50-metre abyss, catapult 100 metres over walls and he is a way better than archer than Legolas! I believe everything!

I apologise for the excessive use of exclamation marks but this movie earns them, and please allow me to drop a few more. This is frigging cinema! This is the reason I love going to the theatres and once in a while I love getting totally stoned out of my senses with the possibilities of cinema!","in anticipation of this movie, i organised a

The last nail in the coffin,,,,,,,[],,
Finally the wait is over .... And my wait was worthful,"It can't be wrong to proclaim that ""Bahubali 2"" was the movie for which almost every section of the Indian Society was waiting.

This is really a first South Indian movie which has created a strong buzz in North India. It is really a pride to see that Indian Cinema can also produce some high budget flicks and can give us some entertainment. I was feeling really proud that I am watching an Indian Movie which is competing Hollywood.

S S Rajamouli really deserves praise from all over India for his exceptional work. Investing 5 years in just two movies is not a joke. But he handled it very smoothly and also the acting of the star cast made this movie a watchable drama. Despite of its lengthy duration.

Story wise it was brilliantly handled by Vijendra Prasad ; Performance wise almost everyone was good ; War sequences were good though some of them were unrealistic ; Heroism scenes were responsible to stick the audience to there seats.

Over all Movie is a visual treat and almost every Indian or foreigner should go watch this movie and witness the great Indian Hindu culture and the glory of Hindu kings as well as Indian cinema.

My rating is 7.9/10.","it can't be wrong to proclaim that ""bahubali 2"" was the movie for which almost every section of the indian society was waiting. this is really a first south indian movie which has created a strong buzz in north india. it is really a pride to see that indian cinema can also produce some high budget flicks and can give us some entertainment. i was feeling really proud that i am watching an indian movie which is competing hollywood. s s rajamouli really deserves praise from all over india for his exceptional work. investing 5 years in just two movies is not a joke. but he handled it very smoothly and also the acting of the star cast made this movie a watchable drama. despite of its lengthy duration. story wise it was brilliantly handled by vijendra prasad ;

MUST WATCH - Exceeds the Magnanimity of Bahubali 1,,,,,,,[],,
OK OK Movie,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I Disappointed for this movie.","if this the best epic indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. sure. it's a huge project. the sets are great. the graphics/cgi are

Why so much hatred?,,,,,,,[],,
An emotional and sensational epic worth a billion views,"Normally in India many directors make a romantic hit and create a lot of fuss about it in the media, just to attract viewers. But Bahubali 2: The Conclusion is above class. It covers every type of viewer, It provides a few minutes of romance mixed with pride and valor. To be honest many times I got tear in my eyes after viewing some of emotional scenes in the movie. It will touch your heart no matter to which age group you belong and whatever gender you are.

I bet everyone will find something for them in this movie to appreciate. This movie have War, courage, style, comedy, drama and mystery everything in it. Prabhas and Daggubati both worked outstanding and the turned themselves immensely into the character. The chemistry of Anuska and Prabhas is so appealing. I'll say this sequel of Bahubali is even better than main movie. Sound and graphics used in movie is just superb. So I would like to give it a 10/10","normally in india many directors make a romantic hit and create a lot of fuss about it in the media, just to attract viewers. but bahubali 2: the conclusion is

Well to Entertainment but not for Classic !,"I just watched this movie in theater on second day of its release. It is watchable as entertainment, but if you look into for more interesting with twist or highly appreciated fight scenes, or something new you definitely be disappointed.

3 of four portions of movie having only flashback and last fourth portion we realized that is hurry to wrap / conclusion the story.

we cant get some answers like, why not Devsena made try to escape from her imprisonment since 25 years, as she was courageous fighter woman, Difference in age between Bhallal and son of Bahubali is 25 years but we see them equal age and equal fight ? How possible this with a 50 years old and a 25 years person ? Big tasks like stopping a mad elephant with a big wooden building, fleeing over coconut tree with wrapping soldiers with shield of metal, uprooting huge trees and many unbelievable things are not digestible in story line, even this is fantasy.

Overall this movie is not to mark up to Hollywood movies like '300' or '300 returns'. The big success of the movie is only done by strategical marketing and 'kattapa ne knyu mara'.

I suggest this movie to watch only for entertainment but keep mind at home with not much expectations.","i just watched this movie in theater on second day of its release. it is watchable as entertainment, but if you look into for more interesting with twist or highly appreciated fight scenes, or something new you definitely be disappointed. 3 of four portions of movie having only flashback and last fourth portion we realized that is hurry to wrap / conclusion the story. we cant get some answers like, why not devsena made try to escape from her imprisonment since 25 years, as she was courageous fighter woman, difference in age between bhallal and son of bahubali is 25 years but we see them equal age and equal fight ?

Words can't describe this movie,"May be the best word i can come with would be, MAGIC. I would like to first thank SS Rajamouli sir for directing this movie and then all the stars who spent their time through this epic. The second movie has more story and drama than the previous title. Keeravani sir did not have much scope in this movie but he left his mark throughout with amazing backgound music.

My anxiety levels have gone up since watching this movie. I just wish this world of Mahishmati is real and these characters could be real. Congratulations to the whole team of Baahubali for making it look so real.

Special credits to the picturazation of some scenes which showed that, folk or traditional look can outmatch the urban style anyday. AWESOME, AWESOME experience. Hope you all feel the same. I recommend everyone to watch the movie. Action sequences are simply great. VFX are good and i didn't much care about them anyway. Would be watching the movie at least two more times in big screen.

Epic Conclusion to a Masterful Franchise!,"The biggest Indian release of the year and, arguably, one of the biggest films of all times released this weekend across the globe to mammoth expectations. The phenomena that is 'Baahubali 2: The Conclusion' has come to shatter box office records 2 years after its predecessor dominated. I don't often write about numbers as they don't speak to a film's true value but in this case it's all worth noting. Released in 4+ languages 'Baahubali: The Beginning' was the highest box office opener of its time (the record is being broken as I write this). Shot over a period of 4 years with a budget of 450+ crores, these 2 movies had the power to make or break the visionary director and producers. Fortunately, the former happened.

Baahubali 2 picks up right after the first film with Kattappa finally revealing Baahubali's fate. The question still looms, ""Kattappa ne Baahubali ko kyun maara."" The answer, explained over the course of the movie, is heartbreaking. While the narrative in the first film took time to unfold, here our senses are overloaded right from the get-go. If you've seen the 1st movie I don't have to explain much. For those who haven't, these are fantasy films based in ancient times where men are Gods and grandeur rules. This is a tale that spans generations- love runs deep, vengeance even deeper, a young village lad becomes king, and kings become demons. I'm not going into specifics because who am I to spoil the director's masterpiece.

S.S. Rajamouli is well known for his unique and brilliant mind having put out countless entertainers in the past. However, he will forever be known as the man behind Baahubali. The scale is massive! In particular, the coronation scene and war sequences are jaw dropping. The budget isn't as large as Hollywood movies (the comparison would be futile) but for what the makers are working with the result is astounding. The beauty also lies in the fact that you're very invested in the story. Rajamouli has a tight grip on his screenplay and embellishes each scene with rich detail. Multiple dialogue writers have worked to make sure the story flows in whichever language you prefer. I watched the Hindi version and was thoroughly entertained by crackling lines like, 'yeh mera vachan hai, mera vachan hi hai shashan' – 'this is my promise, my promise is the law.'

This franchise made overnight superstars of its cast and rightfully so. Prabhas who plays Baahubali and Shiva enacts his parts with aplomb. Rana Daggubati, the evil Bhallaladeva, is rotten to the core and Rana is fiercely devoted to the role. His shear stature shows menace. In a breath of fresh air, the women are powerful; they stand their ground and dictate the narrative. While the men show brawn, the women show brains.

This is an epic movie whose sheer audacity is mesmerizing. It's larger than life and over the top but proudly self aware. What fun!

weekend across the globe to mammoth expectations. the phenomena that is 'baahubali 2: the conclusion' has come to shatter box office records 2 years after its predecessor dominated. i don't often write about numbers as they don't speak to a film's true value but in this case it's all worth noting. released in 4+ languages 'baahubali: the beginning' was the highest box office opener of its time (the record is being broken as i write this). shot over a period of 4 years with a budget of 450+ crores, these 2 movies had the power to make or break the visionary director and producers. fortunately, the former happened. baahubali 2 picks up right after the first film with kattappa finally revealing baahubali's fate. the question still looms, ""kattappa ne baahubali ko kyun maara."" the answer, explained over the course of the movie, is heartbreaking. while the narrative in the first film took time to unfold, here our senses are overloaded right from the get-go. if you've seen the 1st movie i don't have to explain much. for those who haven't, these are fantasy films based in ancient times where men are gods and grandeur rules. this is a tale that spans generations- love runs deep, vengeance even deeper, a young village lad becomes king, and kings become demons. i'm not going into specifics because who am i to spoil the director's masterpiece. s.s. rajamouli is well known for his unique and brilliant mind having put out countless entertainers in the past. however, he will forever be known as the man behind baahubali. the scale is massive! in particular, the coronation scene and war sequences are jaw dropping. the budget isn't as large as hollywood movies (the comparison would be futile) but for what the makers are working with the result is astounding. the beauty also lies in the fact that you're very invested in the story. rajamouli has a tight grip on his screenplay and embellishes each scene with rich detail. multiple dialogue writers have worked to make sure the story flows in whichever language you prefer. i watched the hindi version and was thoroughly entertained by crackling lines like, 'yeh mera vachan hai, mera vachan hi hai shashan' – 'this is my promise, my promise is the law.' this franchise made overnight superstars of its cast and rightfully so. prabhas who plays baahubali and shiva enacts his parts with aplomb. rana daggubati,

More disappointing than expected,"I didn't like the first part. But the place where I stay has monthly movie card and I can see unlimited number of movies from it. So, I thought, what I've got to loose? I'm not paying anything extra for this movie. Turned out, I did loose something i.e. ""hope"". Hope of seeing improved movie making, hope for better CGI and hope for good script, with all the money they had in their hand. This movie might make 1000Cr but it will never be epic cinema it intended for.

I went in with very little expectation but came out even more disappointed.

_______________Case by Case____________

Plot line - Below average script and screenplay.

Acting - Average. As per the expectation I went in with (which was low).

Action - Badly choreographed every where, except for one scene.

VFX - In very few scenes VFX is good. But every other scene (which is 98%) of the movie, you can see CGI miles away.

Songs - Never cared for songs. As usual it was not needed wherever it was.

Comedy - You might smile in 2-3 comedy sketches in first half but smile will fade away pretty quickly and you won't remember any of those as soon as you come out of theater.

So, my wait for a epic realistic war based Indian movie goes on...","i didn't like the first part. but the place where i stay has monthly movie card and i can see unlimited number of movies from it. so, i thought, what i've got to loose?

New Era in Indian Cinema: The Beginning,"There are just four words for whole cast and crew of the Movie..

1.Unpredictable: The Story and The Screenplay, Stories that have been 'Shared' on Social Media, none of them are found in the film..

2.Wonderful: Every scene/sequence gives you goosebumps..

3.Unbelievable: Killing of Bahubali by Kattappa's own hands, will make you emotional..

4. Impressive: Raising waves in the river by gestures of Dev Sena and then carrying the swan boat by the Bahubali across the clouds.. Very Impressive to me..

The role and place (Screenplay) of all the characters in the whole film is wonderful, even the golden statue of Bhallal Dev plays a significant role..

Prabhash, Ramya Krishnan, Anushka, Rana Dagbatti and Nassar have acted in the film to bring the screenplay to new heights.. Music of M M Kreem adding fuel to the fire.. Very magical music and Kaal Bhairav's first song is enough to awaken your curiosity.. Dialogues are very simple though powerful..

Because of twist and turns in the story, you will not know so soon, Why Kattappa killed Bahubali ? You will know this only after the intermission.. There is just one shortcoming in the film, that the 2 hour 47 minute film ended very soon.. If someone rewards for 2 hours 47 minutes to not blink, then that prize would have been mine today.. ...

Satisfactory Conclusion..,,,,,,,[],,
Saaho Re! Triumph of Indian Cinema,"Update on 5/5 I watched the Hindi version yesterday. A second watch allowed me to observe things better. And this time the movie shined in a new light.

Much ballyhoo had been made about the VFX and graphics in the movie - not that they aren't nice, but they're really not what drives this movie.

It's about the story.

It's a simple story - good prevails evil. But the brilliance lies in the way the events unfold and the way Rajamouli has orchestrated the entire flow. I thought the first part of the second half is a master class in storytelling - all the events and sequences leading up to Sivagami escaping are so cleverly sequenced that the tension and emotions build and build and build till one is completely immersed head and heart into the characters.

Overall it's rare for a movie to bring all these diverse cinematic elements and plot ploys so well. I felt like many stories from Indian classics were partially references , making it so easy to connect with.

So the verdict is, it's still strongly moving even on multiple watches.

-----+--+------------

Very rarely comes a movie that pushes the boundaries of possibility - a magical journey that transports your imagination to an elevated world of wonder. Baahubali - the conclusion belongs to that rarefied league.

SS Rajamouli has created a spectacle that will be the gold standard for future Indian cinema to aspire to. The VFX are stupendous, the choreography and action pieces jaw dropping spectacular, and every single frame is stamped with perfection. Take a bow Sabu Cyril and the entire crew for pure cinematographic alchemy. I had a chance to watch the movie in IMAX and am glad I did because of the scale of this epic.

The plot is stupendous, replete with royal politics, intrigue, betrayal, fear, hope, courage and more courage. The dialogues and interactions kept me hooked. The background score of the movie is amazing and dials up the impact by a factor of 11. I read 'he Rise of Sivagami' before watching the movie and it's really fascinating how the story flows so tightly between the two movies and the book.

And no praise is complete without talking about the stupendous performances. Prabhas soars as Amrendra Baahubali and as Shivudu. He slips into the characters with aplomb - effortlessly regal and inspiring as one, and believably impetuous yet heroic in the other. Rana is convincingly sinister and a formidable antagonist. Sivagami, Bijjaladeva, Kattappa all have very strong character realization in this part. However Anushka Shetty steals the thunder as Devasena - she was a spark kept simmering and hidden in the first part, and now she explodes into the narrative-bending blaze in the conclusion.

There is a dignity, a magical quality in every minute of the film, that separates it from all other movies. Director Rajamouli has created the world and tale of Baahubali with such passion, effort and devotion, that it will continue to inspire movie makers and moviegoers for a long, long time.","update on

Feels like seeing Mahabharat in front of me.,"First i am amazed by the creative thinking of Rajamouli. Though it feels some scenes may be a part of some other movie but the way Rajamouli has added that's great. Draupadi like character for Anushka, Shakuni for Bhalal's father, Drithrastra for ShivKamini Devi.

I was left awestruck by seeing the first appearance of Anushka. The way it is defined it adds stars to her beauty.

Bhalal and his father tactics will make you feel everything. Many times in the movie i felt goosebumps.

I felt each emotion in it. Hats off to Rajamouli. And to those who think action might be too much in this to them i would like to say, Hollywood movies like wanted/FF8 are too much in action but still we don't see them as too much. I think Bahubali was a character on which this type of action suits. He was thought as a superhero, so please think like that. And before saying anything think from the creativity side.

At the end i would say, it's not a movie where you read a review and watch. Just watch and have your own review about it.","first i am amazed by the creative thinking of rajamouli. though it feels some scenes may be a part of some other movie but the way rajamouli has added

True Magnum Opus - History in historic cinema making,"My share of two cents to the existing buzz that this film is making. No spoilers so anyone can read.

SS Rajamouli concluded this franchise on a sound note with rip roaring performances and a true magnum opus production. SSR has well understood the expectations pinned to this movie, from its first instalment and delivered or rather should say it's a triumph, truly outperforming the first part. Very few movie franchise does that and with Baahubali 2 SSR hits a master stroke. So without spoiling the storyline I have to say this movie has answered all left over things that was lingering in our minds from the previous instalment which includes the million dollar question why Kattapa killed Baaahubali?

As on whole this movie delivers substance what it is supposed to and to mention on the strong positives the top score will be the VFX, production design and an engaging screenplay that doesn't make you feel bored even for a minute rather promises goose bumps in so many places.

I would be failing my duty if I don't talk about the top notch performances by the entire crew. To be in particular what I felt was the performances by the legendary three stars Ramya Krishna , Sathya Raj and Nasser they were competing each other and outperforming with their acting skills off course I guess this what they call as experience speaks by itself.

Prabhas nails the differences precisely between the father and son characters. Anushka's portrayal as Devasena is an ode to brave royal princess of those days. Rana with his etched body delivers the role perfectly.

On the production design we have seen movies where grandeur is stuffed without need but period films like this it is important that it is rightly done to hit the right note which was one not so saturating thing about this flick makes us feel sad that it has come to an end and wanting more of it.

SSR has broken his own records and made history in historic movie making.

Hit the big screens next to you and immerse in the grandeur.

Disappointed Very Much !!,,,,,,,[],,
A Bit Disappointing...,,,,,,,[],,
Worth the two year wait,"Just to get the big complaint from everyone out of the way... yes, the CG work has a cartoonish edge to it. Know what? Don't care. It's a big ol' fantasy film with flying swan ships and elephants running amok and soldiers being slung like cannonballs.

I loved every second of it.

It's big and loud and full of eye candy — both in the production design and the obvious hard work put in by the two male leads. The cinematography is gorgeous: every frame, bar none, is a painting. Even the musical numbers feel almost organic to the plot. It's a stunning achievement, and I'm sure someone in Hollywood is thinking about an American remake.

I enjoyed this movie,"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline, but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes, interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects. colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. but above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters.",baahubali 2  the conclusion is not quite as good as its predecessor with a somewhat weak storyline  but the film is visually dazzling to behold with great costumes  interiors and phenomenal set pieces and special effects  colorful and exciting  it is also exhilarating  though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story  but above all else  both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most american blockbusters ,"baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film visually dazzling behold great costumes, interiors phenomenal set pieces special effects. colorful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","baahubali 2: conclusion quite good predecessor somewhat weak storyline, film usually dazzling behold great costumes, interior phenomena set pieces special effects. colourful exciting, also exhilarating, though silly action thus succeeds pretty good conclusion story. else, films enjoyable incredibly epic scope world building aspect much better american blockbusters.","['baahubali', '2', 'conclusion', 'quite', 'good', 'predecessor', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'storyline', 'film', 'usually', 'dazzling', 'behold', 'great', 'costumes', 'interior', 'phenomena', 'set', 'pieces', 'special', 'effects', 'colourful', 'exciting', 'also', 'exhilarating', 'though', 'silly', 'action', 'thus', 'succeeds', 'pretty', 'good', 'conclusion', 'story', 'else', 'films', 'enjoyable', 'incredibly', 'epic', 'scope', 'world', 'building', 'aspect', 'much', 'better', 'american', 'blockbusters']",baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomena set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori els film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust,baahubali 2 conclus quit good predecessor somewhat weak storylin film usual dazzl behold great costum interior phenomenon set piec special effect colour excit also exhilar though silli action thu succe pretti good conclus stori el film enjoy incred epic scope world build aspect much better american blockbust

EPIC CONCLUSION to THE BAHUBALI SAGA !,"It's a nearly perfect film ! It has some bad/cringe moments, cheap special effects but these things can't take u away from good parts. The director has a vision ( the thing that lacks in most Indian filmmakers) and he executed it perfectly!

There're plenty of crazy action sequences as bahubali jumps from one bull to another, these things can make u laugh( climax wall jump too). there are plenty to dramatic, emotionally impactful, goosebumps inducing moments that will keep u there.

A mediocre product made by mediocre artists .....,,,,,,,[],,
Why so much hatred ? Watch before posting review !,"Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.

People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.

When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.

Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.

It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.

1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.

2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.

3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.

Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.","why so much hatred on this movie. i wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. i'm surprised not even

An Epic Conclusion To The Celebrated War Drama,"'Baahubali - The Beginning' released back in 2015 was a 'Pan-Indian Blockbuster' that raised the standards of technical brilliance of Indian films with stellar war sequences and awe-inspiring art- direction ,making its Bollywood counter- parts a run for their money.To make a sequel (techncially speaking a prequel) that matches the grandeur and brilliance of the magnum opus 'Baahubali' might look irrealizable,but not for a master craftsman like S.S.Rajamouli who has come up with a stunning piece of cinema that lives upto the hype in all means and even outshines the original as far as the depth of the story-line and a smooth narrative is concerned.

The well-made sequel is without doubt a better movie altogether with a thoroughly convincing and hearty story- line that engages the viewers by inviting them to be a part of the Mahishmati kingdom for its run time of 168 minutes.A more befitting finale to this epic is doubtful and the first half by itself makes it a paisa- vasool affair for the normal movie going audience.

The love-track between Tammana and Prabhas was a let-back in the first part and the best a thing about the conclusion is that it takes care of leaving aside such avoidable sub plots and tries to concentrate in the inner conflicts and emotions of the lead characters making it a hearty affair for the viewers.The first half of the movie was first-rate in this matter and more entertaining on comparison with nevertheless a very good second half.

The way K. V. Vijayendra Prasad handled the answer to the million dollar question ""Why Kattappa Killed Baahubali?"" was brilliant and the overflow of emotions surrounding that question was a delight to watch and made remarkable by brilliant lead performances.The courtroom sequences and the particular arrow fight sequence were exceptional and the highlight of the narrative.

A notable lame-point of the movie was the patchy graphics in few sequences which is too sub-standard considering the mammoth budget of the presentation.The climax portions were good,but not as riveting as the rest of the narrative.

The audience response was enormous for critical sequences and the cheers and whistles ensure that the movie is going to make it big with its impressive 'WOM' among the families and the youth alike.The absence of a breath-taking war sequence like the 'Kalaleya fight' in the first part didn't make any impact,thanks to the brilliant penning of story-line by K.V.Vijayendra Prasad.

Prabhas gave a convincing performance as both Amarendra Bahubali and Mahendra Baahubali with required zeal and intensity that the characters demanded.Anushka was a delight to watch and stamped her authority as a lady action superstar in Indian cinema.Remya Krishnan's act was powerful.Rana Daggubati was good and gave a better performance on comparison with his act in the first.Nasser played his part well.Sathyaraj was lovable and excelled in both comic and emotional sequences.

Songs and background score by M.M.Keeravani were effective and elevated the atmosphere of the narration.All the songs qualify for repeated hearing with the picks being 'Dandaalayya','Oka Praanam' and 'Hamsa Naava'.Cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar was top notch and managed to capture the visual grandeur of the movie.Art direction part was handled well by Sabu Cyril.Editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was good.

Overall,Baahubali -The Conclusion' is a stunning visual extravaganza,a must watch cinematic experience from preferably the best theater in your locality.Take a Bow,SS Rajmouli ! __/\__","'baahubali -

typical masala trash,,,,,,,[],,
Nice Beginning but Excellent Conclusion,"Finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. In the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. In the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. Except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences Indian movies have ever seen. The songs are not that appealing but okay. Overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. So don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how Indian movies have gone to a whole new level. I am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known; but this epic movie is much more than that. in the first half of the movie will begin in a regular pattern and towards the interval as the movie will proceed, things will start to heat up. in the second half everything is there for which you pay your bucks to see a movie. except two or three scenes of exaggerated physics defying effects, the entire movie is packed with the best visual effects and action sequences indian movies have ever seen. the songs are not that appealing but okay. overall the movie is worth the wait and anticipation. so don't just wait reading my or another reviews, just be the part of this epic and see how indian movies have gone to a whole new level. i am gonna watch this movie a few times more (still in the euphoria).","finally the wait for two long years is over and why kattapa killed baahubali is known;

Historic! Best Ever Magnum Opus and Commercial Film in The History of Indian Cinema,"BAHUBALI : THE CONCLUSION REVIEW - A film which has taken Audience anticipation to next level finally released today and how can i miss FDFS? No way, Prequel released 22 months ago and everyone is waiting for the film since then and Film actually Worths that wait. Bahubali2 sets an Example for every Filmmaker in India that how to make a Complete Commercial film for all kind of audience. Almost all Highest grossing Indian films had quality and that quality was converted into commercial success but Bahubali does not have Quality, instead It Is The Best Commercial Film in The History Of Indian Cinema. Let me Elaborate.

Acting- Acting field does not offer anything as characters got nothing to do as an Actor but their Style, Attitude and Passion is Perfect.

Writing - Story also does not offer anything new, but you will get a satisfying answer to why Katappa killed Baahubali.

Screenplay - Outstanding. It offers every upcoming ordinary scene in Extraordinary Fashion. Completely gripped First half with Full dose of Entertainment. Comedy, Action, Claps, Whistles, Goosebumps everything is there. Second half is story oriented and takes pace in last 1 hour.

Music- Music is Dull, don't know why they added songs in this Film? Completely Useless, perhaps the only time when you can leave your seats for a while. But Background score is Brilliant, it is used only in important scenes and it leaves you with Jitters.

Cinematography -Cinematography is of a whole New level, can't imagine this kind of Excellent camera work.

Visual Effects - It's a visual treat to watch Grand and eye pleasing locations and War scenes. Surely gonna swap all awards for VFX.

Direction - After watching Bahubali 1 and 2, i hereby declare SS Rajamouli ""The Best Commercial Director In India."" What a Vision and what an Execution, it is something that's beyond imagination of every good director in India. Some typical south flavor massy scenes are there but forgettable because of many never seen before scenes. Let's take a moment and Appreciate Rajamouli sir for making best ever Historic and Epic Commercial films in the Indian cinema History. After this Film i'm excited what's his Next? I mean just can't stop thinking about his Direction Skills.

Final Words - Overall Bahubali The Conclusion is a MUST WATCH film for Every Indian Who always complaints that our industry can't make Magnum Opus films like Hollywood. This films worth double, triple of whatever your ticket rate is. This film will have highest Repeat Value in this 21st Century. I didn't like Bahubali1 that much still it became Highest Grossing Indian Film, so at Box Office Bahubali2 has no Limits. Just Go for it and enjoy this Historic film, once, twice, thrice or more times. Commercially 10/10, critically 6/10 so i'm going with 8/10* to balance it.","bahubali : the conclusion review - a film which has taken audience anticipation to next level finally released today and

Expectations soiled,"Yes, the movie cannot be skipped, as the first part and the twist question at the end ensure we all will flock to the theatres. So, I'll dwelve rather on what one expected from the movie and what one got.

Exp -Magnum opus with brilliant VFX Act - Brilliant VFX indeed with Kingdom, Dream sequences and war scenes portrayed effectively to border disbelief

Exp - Enhancing the character of Bahubali n son, Devsana, Bhallaldev, Sivagami and Kattappa with brilliant one- liners. Act - Characters watered down with very few one-liners to keep the audience hooked. Sivagami's fierceness gets lost, Kattappa's loyalty questioned, Bhallaldev's might becomes more brain than brawn and worst, even Bahubali ends up wasting his arm strength and skills

Exp- A nuanced script where politics and drama get overshadowed by pure heroics and camera following lead character all the time. Act- A muddled script reminiscent of good old Mahabharat serial of schemes and sub- schemes where Bahubali keeps losing without any retribution

Exp - Music which would create awe and timed beautifully to take the movie forward. Act - BGM remains good enough, but the songs didn't deliver, especially the romantic number between Devsana and Bahubali on which a good share of budget gets wasted

Exp - Last but not the least, an epic climax and final war, which would go on for an hour and where Sivadu finally manages to kill Bhallaldev against all odds Act - Kind of anti climax, which feels edited too much and put together fast enough to ensure reasonable running time and enough shows to hit Rs. 500 Crs collection in a week

All in all, somewhere the commercials seem to have overtaken the story, melodrama overshadowing an epic in making and VFX substituting genuine acting.

Independently, keeping aside the expectations, the film has been done well, with good BGM, main characters building up muscles, graphics team putting a lot of efforts and the costumes team doing well too. The love story between Bahubali and Devsana develops like a typical Bollywood potboiler with fake acting and a caricature wannabe boyfriend in the middle; finally blooming to a romance with a dream sequence in clouds on a flying ship. Anushka shetty as Devasena, to her credit delivers a wonderful performance as the young devasana with strong dialogues and attitude.

However, as the 'Conclusion' ends and a dialogue giving a hint of another sequel pours out, the excitement of crowd is nowhere to be seen. But for those times where you have open mouth stared and cheered for our hero when he nonchalantly massacred people, conquered animals and even challenged nature, 'Jai Mahishmati'.","yes, the movie

Hilarious piece of Junk,,,,,,,[],,
one can sleep after while,,,,,,,[],,
A bad movie hyped up as a great movie,"I really liked baahubali the beginning. Though it was not great,it was a good movie. Now the second part came with so much hype that it was a one in a lifetime experience kind of a movie.

Let me start out by saying this movie is so far fetched from what the ratings say about this movie. Everything about the movie is over the top. Direction, acting, overpowering music, over use of vfx. It seemed like the director wanted to show that they threw a lot of money into every scene to make it look good. Good looks do not make a good movie. There are many illogical and unrealistic scenes that come at regular intervals that make the movie look bad. The vfx were so overused and were used at locations that did not even need them.

In short, the first half had silly comedy and the tempo gets better towards the interval. Second half of the movie starts out good with the story but very predictable as it progresses.

Overall Rajamouli might have increased the scale of imagination and money making with baahubali for telugu movies but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking from legendary directors like KV. Reddy, K. Kameshwara Rao,C. Pullayya, Vittalacharya who made great movies of this genre with limited budget and no graphics.","i really liked baahubali the beginning. though it was not great,it was a good movie. now the second

Don't waste your money or time in this awful movie,,,,,,,[],,
Baahubali 2 is a film that will be remembered across decades,"A strong story line built upon the enriches of Indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. We have a very strong cultural background of Vedas, Puranas and the great mythological epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. I grew up reading these big epics and after so many years I witnessed an epic film - 'Baahubali - A Man with strong arms'. I celebrated this Indian Magnum Opus just like the way I have celebrated all time great blockbusters in Hollywood and Bollywood.

If we can accept the great stories like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings trilogy, the famous Game of thrones series (which has its own heroes following the same dharma - righteous path to combat evil), then we shall also celebrate Baahubali too. SS Rajamouli - (Director) had made sure that we have enough heroic personalities and larger than life characters in our own mythological epic stories. There are many reasons to celebrate the humongous Baahubali 2 too.

Baahubali 2 is not about box office numbers, it is a story which has managed to unite entire India irrespective of state, language, film industry based on a simple question - 'Why Katappa killed Baahubali'?, it is most certain that the direction, power of narration and screenplay has created an impact and liking towards the film. Don't forget, Baahubali 1 - The Beginning had laid the initial footprint two years ago and the first part of the movie was not forgotten.

Baahubali 2 rides on the momentum from where the first part has left. It has it's own filmy moments that deliver goosebumps to the viewers and the famous fight scenes that galore within itself. Claps thud, whistles blow, shouts from the viewers during several moments which cannot be expressed in words. It is a film which doesn't rely solely on VFX, thought it has been touted as the best film with extraordinary visuals. It doesn't disappoint the viewers and the execution was strong enough to make a visual impact.

Baahubali is our own Indian super hero who follows the simple righteous path of Dharma and character is well sculpted. Emphasis is thoroughly laid on every finer detail in the film. Devasena and Sivagami are the two most powerful women characters which one can see in recent times. Bhalaladeva looks intimidatingly venomous through his expressions. Kattappa's is always the go to warrior who bows his head to the King.

Background score of this film has been excellent and it keeps the audience enthralled and entertained. Baahubali's character and it's powerful screen presence gets elevated with magnificent BGM.

Baahubali, undoubtedly is a proud Indian film that broke barriers, it has proved that with a strong subject and excellent directional execution one can reach the sky. Eventually, it is the character Baahubali himself that prevails in every viewer's mind and imagination.

The world wide appreciation as reported from top news channels such as Guardian, Wall street Journal etc has been remarkable. It has set a new benchmark in the Indian film industry and it is striking the doors of Hollywood as it already turned down the some of the newly released Hollywood blockbusters in terms of Box-office collections.

Instead of criticizing the film and finding out flaws in CGI, Indians should stand up and applaud 'Baahubali' for it's impact and contribution to Indian cinema.

My rating is 10/10 and it has been an unbelievable experience watching it on big screen. It is flawless and I take a bow to the hard work put in by the entire cast and crew of the film. It teaches us the sole aspect of belief and execution. SS Rajamouli believed in the subject(Bahubali) with lot of conviction, he braved the odds and he breathed fire and life into it.

The result, we can see everywhere.....thanks to the story teller himself. Baahubali will be remembered across decades and it lives on.....","a strong story line built upon the enriches of indian mythologies and it's closely resembling characters. we have a very strong

Not up-to the mark,,,,,,,[],,
The hype was overwhelming but movie is totally a crap !!,,,,,,,[],,
its a cartoon movie,,,,,,,[],,
"Visual Spectacle, nothing less than a masterpiece!!",,,,,,,[],,
wow am speechlesss !!! ._.,"what a time to be alive to experience something so great like this. So well done, story wise , music-wise and set wise....etc.. wow just wow !!

who says this movie got remarkable vfx graphics?,,,,,,,[],,
An Indian Epic... in true sense of the word!,"Let me begin by saying I was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first half and it didn't feel forced. This movie will grab your attention from the introductory scene (goosebumps worthy) till almost the entire length of the film. It has a high energy throughout and a lot of credit for that goes to the grand visuals along with exceptional acting from all actors, especially Ramya as Shivagami and Prabhas as Amarendra Baahubali.

For me, the most powerful sequence comes in the middle of the movie, this is our GoT moment and this one sequence alone shows the potential of Indian Cinema, you will know what I am talking about once you watch the movie. Another amazing yet subtle thing to notice is how Prabhas has played two different characters, the calm, experienced demeanor of Amarendra Baahubali and the rough- edged, not-groomed persona of Mahendra Baahubali. Kudos to him.

You will notice some over the top action sequences where S. S. Rajamouli has taken liberty to show us fresh imaginative action which adds to the fun factor. The movie does die down towards the end, however that is bound to happen considering the fact that it was adrenaline-pumping for so long.

It takes great directorial vision and deep pockets of producers to make this happen and hopefully the success of this film triggers the rise of more such epics that we can enjoy. This is a must watch. Just the sheer scale of visual effects and production value is breath-taking, no one should miss this.","let me begin by saying i was pleasantly surprised to see quite a bit of humor during the first

Baahubali -The GOAT,"=====SPOILER FREE====

#BAAHUBALI2 is the best film that has ever been made in Indian cinema and considering the amount of emotions that are attached with this film, it is sure to rank among the classics this world has ever produced.India is blessed to have directors like Rajamouli.His creativity and imagination is beyond comparison.He simply brought the best out of all the characters, all the actors.I haven't seen such VFX's, such cinematography, such screenplay anywhere else.

Coming to acting all the actors have delivered career defining performances be it RANA,ANUSHKA,SATHYARAJ,RAMYA,TAMANNA(for the first part) but the man who has simply changed the rules of the game is PRABHAS. There is a certain kind of royalty that is attached to him yet it is his humane nature that makes him absolutely endearing.What an actor!!!He is the definition of what a Superstar is.

VERDICT-Overall Bollywood will never have the balls to make a film like this ever because films like these require passion, commitment, patience and creativity that Bollywood lacks.MAHABHARATA can only be made by RAJAMOULI and nobody else. BAAHUBALI is a phenomenon that will easily earn a minimum of 1000cr.Nothing can best it in the near future.It is a classic that will be foretold to future generation as the ""Movie of this generation"". Go experience this once in a lifetime event.

RATING-This film can't be rated because of its super humanness, magnanimity and grandeur.You have to see it to believe it.","=====spoiler free==== #baahubali2 is the best film that has ever been made

A nonstop and immersive entertainment !!,"The wait is over, Rajamouli and his crew did it again, 2 hr 47 min nonstop and immersive entertainment.

It is simply another visual wonder, didn't realize when it was over. The style of storytelling was excellent, thought it was bit of slow in the beginning, but slowly it picked up and never looked back. Cinematography, natural landscape, settings and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, a visual journey through the Mahishmati and Kunthala Samrajyam. Also with great performances not only by Prabhas and Rana but equally everyone, Nazar was exceptional and in fact he stole the show.

All my stars go towards the story, beautiful picturization, production value and performances. All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge between two brothers but more like an epic to the intuitive beauty of visual effects. It provides an extremely fascinating and touching experience to those who have an affinity for the mythological stories, but it's also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of modern filmmaking for cinema lovers. It's a perfect movie, a film likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in the future. Baahubali – The Conclusion' is visual poetry of the most ancient kind background sceneries, and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. Last but not the least, this is equally (if not superior) in par with Baahubali 1.

Over-hyped with very bad VFX,"What is all the hype about? story is like a typical saas-bahu drama and the VFX sucked. I loved the first one, but this one left me disappointed and how. With such a massive budget they could have made something way better than what was delivered. I guess the critics just went with the hype and gave it good ratings. A lot of unreal sequences that make you laugh at some points, (how does a person get on fire and not burn?). If some of these sequences were in a bollywood film, critics and audiences would've trolled it and given the film bad ratings, then why not for this? i'm shocked at why this film earned so much, maybe cause tickets were priced higher than other movies. overall it's just an Over-hyped movie. don't waste money on it. there are better films way better than this which go unnoticed because of low budgets. just because this movie has earned so much it doesn't make it the best.","what is all the hype about?

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic,"Why Kattapa.. Why?? A question probably 1.4+ billion people have been quizzed about for the past 2 years.. Well, I assure you, the wait for that answer was worth more than the stunts, songs or a budget of 2.5 billion INR.. It probably was a combination of one of the most emotionally and frustratingly epic scene I've ever witnessed in Indian cinema.. Just the grandeur of that one scene gave for some goosebumps; for some a prolonged tear jerker; and for some absolute silence with awe.

The Conclusion is helmed on 5 shoulders.. #Prabhas, #Sathyaraj, #RanaDaggubati, #AnushkaShetty and #RamyaKrishan, who have all done their parts well. But the strength of the movie is Prabhas who literally lived the character. The support cast have all done their parts brilliantly.

3 hours 15 minutes: Having watched it in Bahrain, I was surrounded with the thrill of sitting in a cinema in India; whistles, claps and howls of joy; every scene was celebrated.

This movie had a good mix of soulful songs, witty one liners, amazing sound effects, bgm, beautiful locations (both original and visually created), grand sets, hard hitting stunts and touching moments placed aptly.

I had read earlier that the VFX is in par with #TheLordOfTheRings and #HarryPotter.. I would say it is top notch for Indian cinema.

Although I did not understand a word, I watched this movie in the language it was conceived - Telugu. Wanted to keep it as original as possible. It was a challenge coordinating the scene with the subs, but if I'm still recommending it, you must understand how good this movie must have been.

Kudos to S.S.Rajamouli for bringing to life Indian cinemas first epic.. A theatrical must watch for all.. #Enjoy

Loved the second part 100 more times than first part!,,,,,,,[],,

First time in 26 years of my life I am writing a review,,,,,,,[],,
Nice Conclusion,"‌Bahubali 2 - Nice movie. Finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of Kattappa's betrayal. Movie is a larger than life sequel of the Rise and Fall and again rise of Amrendra Bahubali. Story is good, Special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). Story starts with a quick recap of the first part. Runs with the love story of Bahubali-Devsena, what led to the sacrifice of Sivagami, murder of Bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. Prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. Anushka is good as a Princess and matched well with Prabhas. Rana is Badly good as the previous one. Both Ramaiya and Naseer did well in their respective roles. Tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. Special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(I thought I'm watching a Hercules movie, LOL). Bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. Even after all this, still there is some disappointment (I don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). Movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'Katappa Killed Bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 - nice movie. finally the curtain has been raised over the mystery of kattappa's betrayal. movie is a larger than life sequel of the rise and fall and again rise of amrendra bahubali. story is good, special effects are awesome, songs are not much appealing compared to the previous one and fight scenes are good though have an over dose of unrealism(but we can't complain as it's long awaited bahubali-2). story starts with a quick recap of the first part. runs with the love story of bahubali-devsena, what led to the sacrifice of sivagami, murder of bahubali and ends up with much awaited revenge and win of good over bad. prabhas is good and his larger than life portrayal as a king is awesome. anushka is good as a princess and matched well with prabhas. rana is badly good as the previous one. both ramaiya and naseer did well in their respective roles. tamannah's screen presence is next to nothing. special effects are awesome, specially the fight scenes(i thought i'm watching a hercules movie, lol). bahubali has proved that we are also capable of making such films which can match up to the standard of west. even after all this, still there is some disappointment (i don't know what is leading me to this, may be the expectations were too high). movie is good and give it a shot after all we all deserve to know why 'katappa killed bahubali'.","‌bahubali 2 -

"Average Movie, Insane Audience !","Well we are Indians and we haven't seen an Indian film grossing this sums any time. Is it really worth of crossing 1000 cores mark ??, I may be insane according to many in saying the movie is never a perfect war flick but just a documentary in mixture of Indian sentiments, romantic scenes, immature graphics, loud BM audience elevation scenes and all in all a commercial, nearly 3hours business package, which in the name of REGIONAL PATRIOTISM people poured money tearing their pockets, in lack of genuine judgment. I wonder had any Indian director made a movie like Gladiator, that had a perfect Royal story of unique kind, or had made a movie Titanic, that hit screens way back 1997, it is not a brow rising movement for us, as there would have been temples for the directors. Imagine the graphic content of Harry potter, the very beginner of the series in 2000, can you compare the quality to this great BB2 of 2017 wid17yrs of technology ahead..., and still our people hail it saying THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR BB2, my word !!, the Gods of insanity dancing on our heads. A genuine person of my kind ( I believe so ) should say, should the "" Y "" factor of BB1, (I mean y the man killed the other) carry this huge mess of talk ?? I don't understand, with this kind of technology on update and thousands of movies available, is it this BB2 that should have a bhajan in many parts of modern India. Y not ""Kong"" grab d whole sight of attention despite one of the greatest visuals on screen, imagine a comparison between the bulls scene of BB2 and any scene of Kong and now stick ti your words. When a person says the budget of Kong makes its visuals look much better then a true person must shout out loud ' then why not a movie like Kong had this talk of town and nit an average movie like BB2' well our people don't accept because..., we are Regional Lovers and doubt mind a quality OTHER ! Only two things must clarify this review, either people are "" Frogs in well "" that we know only BB2 so we rate it this high, or they are illiterates, for after watching perfectly classic visual wonders still sticking to "" SAHO BB2 "" becz they understood nothing English !! I conclude saying PV SINDU had the 2nd place of badminton in Olympics recently but got the whole crappy hails and cores of money, while the 1st place Marin took her cash prize to continue life skilled life. I compare Sindu to BB2 and Marin to the really quality movies of west, in India !

Excellent!! Predictable yet it never disappointed me!!,"Hi, guys!! If you have not seen Bahubali 1 & 2 then I would recommend you to watch them now. U will miss the glory of an Indian epic movie if u don't watch it.

This review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. This is not a biased review.

Most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why Katappa killed Bahu Bali, is not a strong reason.

I think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. Or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie.

The reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. Sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. I don't want to spoil the story!!!

I'm a big fan of foreign movies(Hollywood and Korean) because they really make some sensible movies. I was never into Tollywood movies from the beginning. But, I have started watching movies from Tollywood recently and so far ""Bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to Telugu movies.

Reasons:

1. Forget about the VFX, I wasn't expecting much from an Indian movie since the budget is low. But, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and I was impressed by their work.

2. Movie Cast: Yes the cast is excellent, SSR is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. Each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. Even the Junior artists!!!

3. Each & every second that is related to the past is amazing.

4. Though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by SSR is amazing.

5. The movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil.

6. It teaches us ""What exactly the King is?""

7. It teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between King and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant.

8. High in morals, there are so many epic scenes. I don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. You will notice them anyhow.

9. There are situations in which Bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by Dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(Sivagami).

10. The movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. If you believe in yourself you can do anything. (Kumara Varma)

11. It tells us that ""in order to achieve good sometimes you need to do some sacrifices"".

I can write a few more but I'm running out of time I don't want u get bored of by my review.

There are some mistakes in this movie, I think most of the people would not notice them. You will find them in climax as well but who cares by the time you reach climax you will be impressed by the past of Amarendra Bahubali.

Dandalayya song is really awesome, it really suits our King(Prabahs).

The one who is giving a low rating to a movie just because of the mistakes, well I would like to tell them one thing:

""Don't think. FEEEEEEEEL the movie! It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger(mistakes) or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!""","hi, guys!! if you have not seen bahubali 1 & 2 then i would recommend you to watch them now. u will miss the glory of an indian epic movie if u don't watch it. this review is like a message to those sick people who gave low ratings to this epic movie. this is not a biased review. most of the people are trying to criticize this movie saying that the reason, why katappa killed bahu bali, is not a strong reason. i think they have not seen the movie and are trying to degrade this movie. or if they have seen it then they must be holding a personal grudge against the crew who worked for this movie. the reason was given in this movie, it is well & clear. sivagami was blinded by her husband and son. i don't want to spoil the story!!! i'm a big fan of foreign movies(hollywood and korean) because they really make some sensible movies. i was never into tollywood movies from the beginning. but, i have started watching movies from tollywood recently and so far ""bahubali: the conclusion"" tops my list when it comes to telugu movies. reasons: 1. forget about the vfx, i wasn't expecting much from an indian movie since the budget is low. but, our people still pulled it out, they made it big and i was impressed by their work. 2. movie cast: yes the cast is excellent, ssr is really a wise guy when it comes cast in his movies. each and every actor who played their roles fulfilled them with near perfection. even the junior artists!!! 3. each & every second that is related to the past is amazing. 4. though the story is predictable the way it is represented on the movie screen by ssr is amazing. 5. the movie is high with morals, yes it teaches us about the good and evil. 6. it teaches us ""what exactly the king is?"" 7. it teaches us about the importance of relationships, the relationship between king and his people, the relationship between a mother and a son, the relationship between brothers and between a father and a son, and between the ruler and his trustworthy servant. 8. high in morals, there are so many epic scenes. i don't want to spoil this review by mentioning them here. you will notice them anyhow. 9. there are situations in which bahubali will be puzzled and have to decide whether he should stand by his mother or by dharma(ethics) which were taught to him by his mother(sivagami). 10. the movie shows us something which is useful to everyone, it is self-confidence. if you believe in yourself you can do anything.

Hastily made to milk the success of the predecessor,"Baahubali 2 (Conclusion) cannot be considered as just a normal movie, this is supposed to be the Epic conclusion of the biggest Non Hindi blockbuster ever.

Characters, premises are already established in Part 1, so this gives the makers full 2.38 hrs length of time to show the visual magic as expected from the Franchisee. we have to note that Part 1 was slickly edited and racy and mixed with the maximum amount of masala you can ever expect from an India movie, that too with technical perfection on par to Hollywood films

Given the time span of 2 years, given the budget in excess of 250 Crores and given the success of the Part 1, what we get to view is absolute trash. one should look through the visuals and try to think from makers view point. story is very predictable with no twists and turns, dialogues are too simple, penning the screenplay for this movie was an effortless job and doesn't require any imagination

again for the sake of family audience, female characters get more screen space and proceedings are similar to Indian mega serial at least during the first half of the movie Director has tried to keep the action fans happy by prolonging the climax war, which actually was a terribly wrong move, as the movie drags a lot during this period

What accounted for the huge success of Part 1, was its technical perfection and amount of detailing for outdoor and indoor locations, money spend on movie was well utilized and the richness shows on the screen.in the case of Part 2, it seems movie is made of shoe string budget. there are no longer vast locations which should have given the grandeur for the film, instead its easily recognizable even for an normal movie goer that the set design is below avg and CGI usage is terrible

"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion is indeed the beginning of great cinema, Indian Cinema.","Movie: Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (UA)

Rating: 5/5

BAAHUBALI THE BEGINNING took entertainment and Indian cinema both to new heights. So obviously it raised the expectations from BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. And undoubtedly, the conclusion lives up to every expectation and proves to be rather better than the Beginning. Largely because here we have every good element needed for a perfect film, present in this film. I watched the film twice on the big screen. Such great films should be seen on the big screen and not on pirated prints.

BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is a perfect film which defines Indian cinema and culture. This isn't just a film, it's a grand celebration that must be celebrated at theatres. We don't get to see such great films daily. This film is really better than the Beginning because it offers more intensity, emotion, high voltage action, splendid visuals and goosebumps-inducing sequences. Even while watching it second time, I got goosebumps in certain sequences. This is really an unmissable family entertainer. There's no vulgarity or obscenity in this film. Kids can definitely watch and enjoy this film.

The best part of the film is...the entire film! I can't describe in words how entertaining this film is and it's really hard to choose only one or two scenes as favourite. SS Rajamouli proves himself yet again, along with his entire team. Every single character will be remembered in the history of Indian Cinema. Besides, there's a lot of creativity visible in BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION. From the beginning to intermission to the end: each and every scene is 100% engaging and wonderfully shot. The action sequences are very enjoyable and perfectly executed. This is really the BEST action film ever, ever, ever.

The visuals are breathtaking. Splendid and presented with sharp details, the visual effects make you fall in love with the film. Prabhas is as entertaining and excellent as usual. Rana Daggubati is excellent in his role. As a character you'll hate him but as an actor you'll salute him. Anushka Shetty impresses big time. Sathyaraj...I mean what an actor! His performance is absolutely perfect. The music is really good and will stay with you for long. Cinematography too deserves a special mention for capturing this film in an excellent way. And how can one forget to praise the writer Vijayendra Prasad, who wrote this epic? Just praising won't do. A big salute!!!!!

Undoubtedly, BAAHUBALI THE CONCLUSION is the best film of Indian Cinema. If you liked the beginning, you'll definitely like the conclusion. Even if you didn't, you'll love this part. And I loved both. The Conclusion however is, as I said before, better than the Beginning. Come on, now don't look at the negative reviews and watch this film in theatres with your family. And after watching it twice in theatre, I'm thinking about a third watch too...","movie: baahubali 2: the conclusion (ua) rating: 5/5 baahubali the beginning took entertainment and indian cinema both

Amazing Bahubalistic VFX Treat,"I am not going to start my review with the most discussed topic ""Why Katappa killed Bahubali"" as this is just a small footnote in this magnum opus. There is much more to the film than just this .Many of you won't believe me, but trust me, I have watched it and can vouch for it !!

The Plot: The story continues from where it left off in Part one. The heir to the throne of the mighty Mahishmati empire, prince Amarendra Bahubali (Prabhas) along with Katappa ( Sathyaraj) are sent on a covert mission to mix with the subjects and get to know them better. During their travels Bahubali meets Devsena ( Anushka Shetty) , princess of Kuntal Rajya and falls in love with her. Unknown to him BhallalDeva ( Duggubati) along with his father ( Nassar) are busy planning Bahubali's downfall .They succeed in doing so by creating a misunderstanding between his godmother Sivagami(Ramya) and prevent him from ascending the throne . Ballaldeva is instead made king and along with his scheming father forces Bahubali out of the palace. Amerandra Bahubali meets a tragic end at the hands of his mentor Katappa (won't reveal the plot or I will be roasted alive by die hard fans who still haven't read about it on the WhatsApp messages going viral !!).

The rest of the story focuses on the present where Bahubali's son, Mahendra joins hands with evergreen Katappa ( Omg !! the guy is still alive and kicking after all this while .. a true Bhishma Pitamaha of the story !!) to fight the antagonist BhallalDeva, avenge his fathers death and finally regain the throne of Maheshmati.

The story is nothing new  we all knew how it would end all hunky dory . Everyone goes home happy happy!!

Cast: The Protagonist / Antagonist duo Prabhas and Duggubati are well matched adversaries and the climax is a visual treat even though it has been stretched a bit. Prabhas done a great job and has a lot of ""seeti bajao"" moments throughout the film especially the one when he mount an elephant by stepping on its trunk.We know that it is all VFX but yet enjoy and savor the moment.

Nassar as Bhallaldeva's father is nice with a Shakuni mama kind of look to his character.Again, VFX used to create his crippled arm is amazing !!

Anushkha Shetty as the feisty Devsena and Ramya as Sivagami , the de-facto ruler of Mahishmati have very strong and well etched out characters . Their confrontation scenes hold you in awe and steal the thunder from their male counterparts. A rare achievement not often seen in Indian cinema!! Tammanna, unfortunately doesn't have anything much and is seen only in a handful of scenes .

Why you should watch it on the big screen only: It is very rare that you get to see an Indian movie laden with such amazing special effects. It gives an Amar Chitra Katha type of feel to the whole story which indeed refreshing. The whole look is pleasing to the eye with innovative action scenes, awesome costumes and lavish sets . I loved the movie  total paisa vasool even though it is far far away from reality but then that's how Indian films are supposed to be  aren't they !!!!

Go watch it and enjoy the glory of Bahubali unfold !!","i am not going to start my review with the most discussed topic ""why katappa killed bahubali"" as this is just a small footnote in this magnum

Fewer risks taken and still devoid of cynicism. This is still a piece of great cinema,"In anticipation of this movie, I organised a screening of the 2015 magnum opus for friends at my humble abode and I can safely proclaim that everyone enjoyed it. There are some movies which are not meant to be enjoyed alone; the spontaneous uproarious unbridled fist-pumping reactions of an audience drive up the enjoyment of the movie to a whole new level. Baahubali: The Beginning is that type of movie. With the right mindset and an adventurous spirit, the movie can open a door into a whole new world of cinematic pleasure.

Baahubali: The Beginning literally ends with a jaw-dropping cliffhanger that matches the driving ambition of the narrative. For more than a year, I was thinking about how S.S. Rajamouli would explain the ending and after watching Baahubali 2: The Conclusion I was not only more than satisfied, I was stunned out of my senses. Putting both movies together, I can now clearly see that part 1 is just a world-building and character set-up appetiser, the scrumptious main dish and delectable dessert are all in the sequel. What a blast! That's it! Review is done! Go buy a ticket already!

Still here? Okay let me drop a few more paragraphs

Baahabuli 2 takes us back to the kingdom of Mahishmati and puts a spotlight on the feud between Baahubali (Prabhas) and Bhallala Deva (Rana Daggubati). Will Shiva, the son of Baahubali, succeed against the tyrannical and treacherous Bhallala Deva? Will he regain authority of the kingdom that was snatched from his family by Bhallala Deva? Why did Bhallala Deva keep Devasena (Anushka Shetty) captive all these years? Why is Sivagami so determined to save the baby that she literally drowned standing up in a torrent of on- rushing water? Finally, the million-dollar question that was literally the final frame of Baahubali 1 is answered.

S.S. Rajamouli's method of upping the ante for the sequel is the typical ""more is better"" approach, but he takes it much further. The visual opulence is astonishing, the kaleidoscope of colours awe-inspiring, the humongous sets jaw-dropping and the costumes resplendent beyond my wildest dreams. Every frame is meticulously crafted. Every detail and stylistic serve the narrative. He clearly understands what made the first movie so well-loved and we are given not one, not two, but three battles involving huge armies. But kudos to him for not making the battles feel repetitive by underscoring them with different stakes and fighting methods. The last one involving tall trees and human catapults is so inventive. I have seen hundreds of battles on the big screen, but I have never seen what was depicted here.

Just like the earlier movie, this one reinvents its own rules and is totally devoid of cynicism. Comparing with the first film, Rajamouli takes fewer risks in this outing, but the narrative is still joyous and filled with court intrigue, family drama and deadly double-crosses. The characters may be the size of mountains, but they are flawed human beings with weaknesses that are absolutely cathartic. Yes, I know the main caveat on most people's mouth is that it is way over the top. But for this armchair movie buff and part-time critic, the storytelling is so compelling, the characters so larger than life, the love story so affecting and the energy so propulsive that I didn't mind swimming in the sheer excess. Heck! Baahubali is meant to leap across a 50-metre abyss, catapult 100 metres over walls and he is a way better than archer than Legolas! I believe everything!

I apologise for the excessive use of exclamation marks but this movie earns them, and please allow me to drop a few more. This is frigging cinema! This is the reason I love going to the theatres and once in a while I love getting totally stoned out of my senses with the possibilities of cinema!","in anticipation of this movie, i organised a

The last nail in the coffin,,,,,,,[],,
Finally the wait is over .... And my wait was worthful,"It can't be wrong to proclaim that ""Bahubali 2"" was the movie for which almost every section of the Indian Society was waiting.

This is really a first South Indian movie which has created a strong buzz in North India. It is really a pride to see that Indian Cinema can also produce some high budget flicks and can give us some entertainment. I was feeling really proud that I am watching an Indian Movie which is competing Hollywood.

S S Rajamouli really deserves praise from all over India for his exceptional work. Investing 5 years in just two movies is not a joke. But he handled it very smoothly and also the acting of the star cast made this movie a watchable drama. Despite of its lengthy duration.

Story wise it was brilliantly handled by Vijendra Prasad ; Performance wise almost everyone was good ; War sequences were good though some of them were unrealistic ; Heroism scenes were responsible to stick the audience to there seats.

Over all Movie is a visual treat and almost every Indian or foreigner should go watch this movie and witness the great Indian Hindu culture and the glory of Hindu kings as well as Indian cinema.

My rating is 7.9/10.","it can't be wrong to proclaim that ""bahubali 2"" was the movie for which almost every section of the indian society was waiting. this is really a first south indian movie which has created a strong buzz in north india. it is really a pride to see that indian cinema can also produce some high budget flicks and can give us some entertainment. i was feeling really proud that i am watching an indian movie which is competing hollywood. s s rajamouli really deserves praise from all over india for his exceptional work. investing 5 years in just two movies is not a joke. but he handled it very smoothly and also the acting of the star cast made this movie a watchable drama. despite of its lengthy duration. story wise it was brilliantly handled by vijendra prasad ;

MUST WATCH - Exceeds the Magnanimity of Bahubali 1,,,,,,,[],,
OK OK Movie,"If this the best epic Indian movie industry can dish out, its time to contemplate where its headed. Sure. It's a huge project. The sets are great. The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors.

An emotional and sensational epic worth a billion views,"Normally in India many directors make a romantic hit and create a lot of fuss about it in the media, just to attract viewers. But Bahubali 2: The Conclusion is above class. It covers every type of viewer, It provides a few minutes of romance mixed with pride and valor. To be honest many times I got tear in my eyes after viewing some of emotional scenes in the movie. It will touch your heart no matter to which age group you belong and whatever gender you are.

I bet everyone will find something for them in this movie to appreciate. This movie have War, courage, style, comedy, drama and mystery everything in it. Prabhas and Daggubati both worked outstanding and the turned themselves immensely into the character. The chemistry of Anuska and Prabhas is so appealing. I'll say this sequel of Bahubali is even better than main movie. Sound and graphics used in movie is just superb. So I would like to give it a 10/10","normally in india many directors make a romantic hit and create a lot of fuss about it in the media, just to attract viewers. but bahubali 2: the conclusion is

Well to Entertainment but not for Classic !,"I just watched this movie in theater on second day of its release. It is watchable as entertainment, but if you look into for more interesting with twist or highly appreciated fight scenes, or something new you definitely be disappointed.

3 of four portions of movie having only flashback and last fourth portion we realized that is hurry to wrap / conclusion the story.

we cant get some answers like, why not Devsena made try to escape from her imprisonment since 25 years, as she was courageous fighter woman, Difference in age between Bhallal and son of Bahubali is 25 years but we see them equal age and equal fight ? How possible this with a 50 years old and a 25 years person ? Big tasks like stopping a mad elephant with a big wooden building, fleeing over coconut tree with wrapping soldiers with shield of metal, uprooting huge trees and many unbelievable things are not digestible in story line, even this is fantasy.

Overall this movie is not to mark up to Hollywood movies like '300' or '300 returns'. The big success of the movie is only done by strategical marketing and 'kattapa ne knyu mara'.

I suggest this movie to watch only for entertainment but keep mind at home with not much expectations.","i just watched this movie in theater on second day of its release. it is watchable as entertainment, but if you look into for more interesting with twist or highly appreciated fight scenes, or something new you definitely be disappointed. 3 of four portions of movie having only flashback and last fourth portion we realized that is hurry to wrap / conclusion the story. we cant get some answers like, why not devsena made try to escape from her imprisonment since 25 years, as she was courageous fighter woman, difference in age between bhallal and son of bahubali is 25 years but we see them equal age and equal fight ?

Cringe fest of overwhelming production,"The title justifies the movie. Cringy action scenes, boring screenplay and the duration! God! The duration almost strangled me to death.

Over Hyped Popularity - Average Story,"The low grade animated effects are awful and were counter productive. Songs were distracting and not really good either. Why does it always have to be over budgeted songs when it could have been much better without them.

Nothing special except for the fact that it was a great attempt to make Indian cinema better for global audiences. It is far better than regular ""Bollywood"" dramas and at times did match the international quality in terms of storytelling. Actually liked the 1st part better, as it ends with a twist.

Words can't describe this movie,"May be the best word i can come with would be, MAGIC. I would like to first thank SS Rajamouli sir for directing this movie and then all the stars who spent their time through this epic. The second movie has more story and drama than the previous title. Keeravani sir did not have much scope in this movie but he left his mark throughout with amazing backgound music.

My anxiety levels have gone up since watching this movie. I just wish this world of Mahishmati is real and these characters could be real. Congratulations to the whole team of Baahubali for making it look so real.

Special credits to the picturazation of some scenes which showed that, folk or traditional look can outmatch the urban style anyday. AWESOME, AWESOME experience. Hope you all feel the same. I recommend everyone to watch the movie. Action sequences are simply great. VFX are good and i didn't much care about them anyway. Would be watching the movie at least two more times in big screen.

Epic Conclusion to a Masterful Franchise!,"The biggest Indian release of the year and, arguably, one of the biggest films of all times released this weekend across the globe to mammoth expectations. The phenomena that is 'Baahubali 2: The Conclusion' has come to shatter box office records 2 years after its predecessor dominated. I don't often write about numbers as they don't speak to a film's true value but in this case it's all worth noting. Released in 4+ languages 'Baahubali: The Beginning' was the highest box office opener of its time (the record is being broken as I write this). Shot over a period of 4 years with a budget of 450+ crores, these 2 movies had the power to make or break the visionary director and producers. Fortunately, the former happened.

Baahubali 2 picks up right after the first film with Kattappa finally revealing Baahubali's fate. The question still looms, ""Kattappa ne Baahubali ko kyun maara."" The answer, explained over the course of the movie, is heartbreaking. While the narrative in the first film took time to unfold, here our senses are overloaded right from the get-go. If you've seen the 1st movie I don't have to explain much. For those who haven't, these are fantasy films based in ancient times where men are Gods and grandeur rules. This is a tale that spans generations- love runs deep, vengeance even deeper, a young village lad becomes king, and kings become demons. I'm not going into specifics because who am I to spoil the director's masterpiece.

S.S. Rajamouli is well known for his unique and brilliant mind having put out countless entertainers in the past. However, he will forever be known as the man behind Baahubali. The scale is massive! In particular, the coronation scene and war sequences are jaw dropping. The budget isn't as large as Hollywood movies (the comparison would be futile) but for what the makers are working with the result is astounding. The beauty also lies in the fact that you're very invested in the story. Rajamouli has a tight grip on his screenplay and embellishes each scene with rich detail. Multiple dialogue writers have worked to make sure the story flows in whichever language you prefer. I watched the Hindi version and was thoroughly entertained by crackling lines like, 'yeh mera vachan hai, mera vachan hi hai shashan' – 'this is my promise, my promise is the law.'

This franchise made overnight superstars of its cast and rightfully so. Prabhas who plays Baahubali and Shiva enacts his parts with aplomb. Rana Daggubati, the evil Bhallaladeva, is rotten to the core and Rana is fiercely devoted to the role. His shear stature shows menace. In a breath of fresh air, the women are powerful; they stand their ground and dictate the narrative. While the men show brawn, the women show brains. Anushka Shetty (Devasena) and Ramya Krishnan's (Sivagami) work is applaudable. And who can forget the loyal to a fault Kattappa enacted by Sathyaraj. Everyone would want a companion like himor would they?

This is an epic movie whose sheer audacity is mesmerizing. It's larger than life and over the top but proudly self aware. What fun! It was a joy to experience on the big screen and proved that, sometimes, sequels can be bigger and better. Baahubali 2 shows what filmmakers can accomplish with the right vision. I'm eager to see others taking inspiration from this because creativity has no limits.","the biggest indian release of the year and, arguably, one of the biggest films of all times released this

More disappointing than expected,"I didn't like the first part. But the place where I stay has monthly movie card and I can see unlimited number of movies from it. So, I thought, what I've got to loose? I'm not paying anything extra for this movie. Turned out, I did loose something i.e. ""hope"". Hope of seeing improved movie making, hope for better CGI and hope for good script, with all the money they had in their hand. This movie might make 1000Cr but it will never be epic cinema it intended for.

I went in with very little expectation but came out even more disappointed.

_______________Case by Case____________

Plot line - Below average script and screenplay.

Acting - Average. As per the expectation I went in with (which was low).

Action - Badly choreographed every where, except for one scene.

VFX - In very few scenes VFX is good. But every other scene (which is 98%) of the movie, you can see CGI miles away.

Songs - Never cared for songs. As usual it was not needed wherever it was.

Comedy - You might smile in 2-3 comedy sketches in first half but smile will fade away pretty quickly and you won't remember any of those as soon as you come out of theater.

So, my wait for a epic realistic war based Indian movie goes on...","i didn't like the first part. but the place where i stay has monthly movie card and i can see unlimited number of movies from it. so, i thought, what i've got to loose?

New Era in Indian Cinema: The Beginning,"There are just four words for whole cast and crew of the Movie..

1.Unpredictable: The Story and The Screenplay, Stories that have been 'Shared' on Social Media, none of them are found in the film..

2.Wonderful: Every scene/sequence gives you goosebumps..

3.Unbelievable: Killing of Bahubali by Kattappa's own hands, will make you emotional..

4. Impressive: Raising waves in the river by gestures of Dev Sena and then carrying the swan boat by the Bahubali across the clouds.. Very Impressive to me..

The role and place (Screenplay) of all the characters in the whole film is wonderful, even the golden statue of Bhallal Dev plays a significant role..

Prabhash, Ramya Krishnan, Anushka, Rana Dagbatti and Nassar have acted in the film to bring the screenplay to new heights.. Music of M M Kreem adding fuel to the fire.. Very magical music and Kaal Bhairav's first song is enough to awaken your curiosity.. Dialogues are very simple though powerful..

Because of twist and turns in the story, you will not know so soon, Why Kattappa killed Bahubali ? You will know this only after the intermission.. There is just one shortcoming in the film, that the 2 hour 47 minute film ended very soon.. If someone rewards for 2 hours 47 minutes to not blink, then that prize would have been mine today.. ...

Satisfactory Conclusion..,,,,,,,[],,
Saaho Re! Triumph of Indian Cinema,"Update on 5/5 I watched the Hindi version yesterday. A second watch allowed me to observe things better. And this time the movie shined in a new light.

Much ballyhoo had been made about the VFX and graphics in the movie - not that they aren't nice, but they're really not what drives this movie.

It's about the story.

It's a simple story - good prevails evil. But the brilliance lies in the way the events unfold and the way Rajamouli has orchestrated the entire flow. I thought the first part of the second half is a master class in storytelling - all the events and sequences leading up to Sivagami escaping are so cleverly sequenced that the tension and emotions build and build and build till one is completely immersed head and heart into the characters.

Overall it's rare for a movie to bring all these diverse cinematic elements and plot ploys so well. I felt like many stories from Indian classics were partially references , making it so easy to connect with.

So the verdict is, it's still strongly moving even on multiple watches.

-----+--+------------

Very rarely comes a movie that pushes the boundaries of possibility - a magical journey that transports your imagination to an elevated world of wonder. Baahubali - the conclusion belongs to that rarefied league.

SS Rajamouli has created a spectacle that will be the gold standard for future Indian cinema to aspire to. The VFX are stupendous, the choreography and action pieces jaw dropping spectacular, and every single frame is stamped with perfection. Take a bow Sabu Cyril and the entire crew for pure cinematographic alchemy. I had a chance to watch the movie in IMAX and am glad I did because of the scale of this epic.

The plot is stupendous, replete with royal politics, intrigue, betrayal, fear, hope, courage and more courage. The dialogues and interactions kept me hooked. The background score of the movie is amazing and dials up the impact by a factor of 11. I read 'he Rise of Sivagami' before watching the movie and it's really fascinating how the story flows so tightly between the two movies and the book.

And no praise is complete without talking about the stupendous performances. Prabhas soars as Amrendra Baahubali and as Shivudu. He slips into the characters with aplomb - effortlessly regal and inspiring as one, and believably impetuous yet heroic in the other. Rana is convincingly sinister and a formidable antagonist. Sivagami, Bijjaladeva, Kattappa all have very strong character realization in this part. However Anushka Shetty steals the thunder as Devasena - she was a spark kept simmering and hidden in the first part, and now she explodes into the narrative-bending blaze in the conclusion.

There is a dignity, a magical quality in every minute of the film, that separates it from all other movies. Director Rajamouli has created the world and tale of Baahubali with such passion, effort and devotion, that it will continue to inspire movie makers and moviegoers for a long, long time.","update on

other movies. director rajamouli has created the world and tale of baahubali with such passion, effort and devotion, that it will continue to inspire movie makers and moviegoers for a long, long time.","update on 5/5 i watched the hindi version yesterday. a second watch allowed me to observe things better. and this time the movie shined in a new light. much ballyhoo had been made about the vfx and graphics in the movie - not that they aren't nice, but they're really not what drives this movie. it's about the story. it's a simple story - good prevails evil. but the brilliance lies in the way the events unfold and the way rajamouli has orchestrated the entire flow. i thought the first part of the second half is a master class in storytelling - all the events and sequences leading up to sivagami escaping are so cleverly sequenced that the tension and emotions build and build and build till one is completely immersed head and heart into the characters. overall it's rare for a movie to bring all these diverse cinematic elements and plot ploys so well. i felt like many stories from indian classics were partially references , making it so easy to connect with. so the verdict is, it's still strongly moving even on multiple watches. -----+--+------------ very rarely comes a movie that pushes the boundaries of possibility - a magical journey that transports your imagination to an elevated world of wonder. baahubali - the conclusion belongs to that rarefied league. ss rajamouli has created a spectacle that will be the gold standard for future indian cinema to aspire to. the vfx are stupendous, the choreography and action pieces jaw dropping spectacular, and every single frame is stamped with perfection. take a bow sabu cyril and the entire crew for pure cinematographic alchemy. i had a chance to watch the movie in imax and am glad i did because of the scale of this epic. the plot is stupendous, replete with royal politics, intrigue, betrayal, fear, hope, courage and more courage. the dialogues and interactions kept me hooked. the background score of the movie is amazing and dials up the impact by a factor of 11. i read 'he rise of sivagami' before watching the

Feels like seeing Mahabharat in front of me.,"First i am amazed by the creative thinking of Rajamouli. Though it feels some scenes may be a part of some other movie but the way Rajamouli has added that's great. Draupadi like character for Anushka, Shakuni for Bhalal's father, Drithrastra for ShivKamini Devi.

I was left awestruck by seeing the first appearance of Anushka. The way it is defined it adds stars to her beauty.

Bhalal and his father tactics will make you feel everything. Many times in the movie i felt goosebumps.

I felt each emotion in it. Hats off to Rajamouli. And to those who think action might be too much in this to them i would like to say, Hollywood movies like wanted/FF8 are too much in action but still we don't see them as too much. I think Bahubali was a character on which this type of action suits. He was thought as a superhero, so please think like that. And before saying anything think from the creativity side.

At the end i would say, it's not a movie where you read a review and watch. Just watch and have your own review about it.","first i am amazed by the creative thinking of rajamouli. though it feels some scenes may be a part of some other movie but the way rajamouli has added

True Magnum Opus - History in historic cinema making,"My share of two cents to the existing buzz that this film is making. No spoilers so anyone can read.

SS Rajamouli concluded this franchise on a sound note with rip roaring performances and a true magnum opus production. SSR has well understood the expectations pinned to this movie, from its first instalment and delivered or rather should say it's a triumph, truly outperforming the first part. Very few movie franchise does that and with Baahubali 2 SSR hits a master stroke. So without spoiling the storyline I have to say this movie has answered all left over things that was lingering in our minds from the previous instalment which includes the million dollar question why Kattapa killed Baaahubali?

As on whole this movie delivers substance what it is supposed to and to mention on the strong positives the top score will be the VFX, production design and an engaging screenplay that doesn't make you feel bored even for a minute rather promises goose bumps in so many places.

I would be failing my duty if I don't talk about the top notch performances by the entire crew. To be in particular what I felt was the performances by the legendary three stars Ramya Krishna , Sathya Raj and Nasser they were competing each other and outperforming with their acting skills off course I guess this what they call as experience speaks by itself.

Prabhas nails the differences precisely between the father and son characters. Anushka's portrayal as Devasena is an ode to brave royal princess of those days. Rana with his etched body delivers the role perfectly.

On the production design we have seen movies where grandeur is stuffed without need but period films like this it is important that it is rightly done to hit the right note which was one not so saturating thing about this flick makes us feel sad that it has come to an end and wanting more of it.

SSR has broken his own records and made history in historic movie making.

Hit the big screens next to you and immerse in the grandeur.

Disappointed Very Much !!,,,,,,,[],,
A Bit Disappointing...,,,,,,,[],,
Worth the two year wait,"Just to get the big complaint from everyone out of the way... yes, the CG work has a cartoonish edge to it. Know what? Don't care. It's a big ol' fantasy film with flying swan ships and elephants running amok and soldiers being slung like cannonballs.

I loved every second of it.

It's big and loud and full of eye candy — both in the production design and the obvious hard work put in by the two male leads. The cinematography is gorgeous: every frame, bar none, is a painting. Even the musical numbers feel almost organic to the plot. It's a stunning achievement, and I'm sure someone in Hollywood is thinking about an American remake.

Go see it. You will not be disappointed. But see the first one before you do. The only thing that prevents a full ten star on this was I got a little confused by the timeline. But once you figure that out, you see it as even more of an achievement because of the artful way the director ties them back and forth.","just to get the big complaint from everyone out of the way... yes, the cg work has a cartoonish edge to it. know what?

Lot Of paid reviewers are giving it 1* - juz here to say the TRUTH..,"Its shocking these negative'reviwers'are giving it only 1* to the HIGHEST GROSSING Indian MOVIE OF ALL TIME!even really awful films don't get such bad reviews.just got provoked & came here to give true review,so many people cant go wrong,as it has reached 1000cr. mark already,something bollywood didn't do in decades.It's one of the most spectacular movies you've ever watched.

Right from music score to VFX to costume/jewelry all is grand,there's lot of science/gravity- defying stunts/VFX(1 scene can amuse you too)which can be jaw dropping but it's the dedication and hard work of all actors which makes it all BELIEVABLE,as it is truly larger-than-life period fictional drama,you cant really question its powerful rationality,so overall it does convince you.In fact its a very proud moment for all of us as it's a

hit even in Pakistan, besides all over the world.I was lucky enough to watch on the 1st day,For the first time in life i saw people CLAPPING at the end of the movie,as its truly quadruple worth of your money.people were ready to buy expensive tickets and even piracy didn't affected its collections.

I am in Love with prabhas after this movie,Anushka(devsena) really justified her role,& only a guy like Rana(bhalla)can make fighting with prabhas(shiva)convincing,shivgami(ramya) is my fav character.The acting of all characters are so strong,you don't even realise you are watching a dubbed version(Hindi)hats off to all dubbing artists as well.Songs truly show their power right from the starting credits and you actually leave the theatre feeling proud of the Indian culture and tradition (though its a fictional world inspired from mythology)right from costumes/jewelry to music to ancient architectures to the whole plot line,it shows its Indian color.It really feels great to watch one of the greatest Indian movie EVER and you will NEVER regret watching the movie,at least.","its

A Solid effort and technically brilliant.,"Baahubali-2 takes off right where the Baahubali - The beginning ended, with the now famous question... Why Kattappa killed Baahubali? The story feels much more coherent now that the loose ends are tied really well.

There is so much more to the story of Baahubali than the WKKB question. The story takes us through the Love blooming between Amarendra Baahubali and Devasena, then delves into the Politics in the Mahishmathi Kingdom and some shocking revelations ensure the pace is kept high and then comes the sequence of Kattappa killing Baahubali. From then, the story becomes predictable and turns into a clichéd revenge drama. But the greatness of SS Rajamouli as a top- notch technician of the movie lies in how well he keeps the audience engaged and absorbed into the story. The entire narrative of Baahubali has been fleshed out and the emotions are handled very well indeed. The sequence of Kattappa and Baahubali has been used for maximum dramatic effect.

Wherever there are no strong emotions to keep us focused, Rajamouli resorts to Visuals.A separate mention has to go to the Visuals of the movie. The movie is visually stunning. So stunning indeed that it is one of, if not the most beautiful Indian film so far. Every frame of it oozes grandeur. Some of the sequences, especially the Visuals of the Romance song between Devasena and Baahubali match the standards of Hollywood. No doubt about it.

However, that is where the comparison with Hollywood must end, in all fairness. The movie is Indian at its core and the story, which heavily draws inspiration from the famous characters of Maha Bharatha is not new to the audience. It is an age old tale of Sibling Rivalry set in a different world and its saving grace are the great characters that populate the world of Baahubali. The actors have done a great job with stellar performances from Anushka, Satyaraj, RamyaKrishna, Nasser and Rana. They all acted very well. But ultimately it is Prabhas that steals the show. His performance is apt, controlled and is almost always on point. He never over-does his role.

All the technicians that have worked for the film have done a fabulous job as well. The music by MM Keeravani is wonderful and his BGM takes the experience to new heights. Senthil Kumar's cinematography is another big plus for the movie.

The pacing of the movie is amazing but it falters towards the end, as what happens becomes predictable and in the final battle, the viewers are treated at the same time to wonderful visuals and clichés. However, the events leading to the climax more than make up for it. Ultimately the ending is a safe one and the final sequence neatly ties it to the beginning of the first movie. Very sublime.

Finally, Baahubali is today's blockbuster, tomorrow's classic and is definitely one of the most important films for Indian movie industry. Watch it for the Visuals and Rajamouli's superb narration. It is an Indian film with an Indian story and is suffused with Indian sensibilities. That makes it a breathe of fresh air.","baahubali-2 takes off right where the baahubali - the beginning ended, with the now famous question... why kattappa killed baahubali? the story feels much more

"Gripping palace intrigue, below par war scenes","Rejoice, because until you are a very patient listener or an extremely fast reader, or have uncomplaining friends, who are willing to spend a good chunk of the day, explaining the palace intrigue, verbally or in the written form, that leads to the answer that everyone wants to know, you are safe. Prima facie, quite a lot of thought seems to have gone into writing the screenplay and fine tuning every scene, because of which the action and dramatic set pieces are awe inspiring. I don't wish to write about them, as I don't want to be a spoil sport. The director pleasantly surprised me by fleshing out Kattappa's role and peppering it with a lot of humor, which gave the proceedings a lot of levity and fun. My gripe with The Conclusion: The part that I loved the most in The Beginning was the war scene in the second half, which lasted for close to 3 quarters of an hour. There are no such extended orgasm inducing battle scenes, this time around. There are a lot of sequences that have been shot in the dark, and consequently, had much less of an impact on me. Also, the graphics seemed kind of tacky. It looked like a perfect example of the bigger not necessarily being the better.","rejoice, because until you are a very patient listener or an extremely fast reader, or have uncomplaining friends,

"Excellent Ending of the Cult Classic saga: ""Baahubali""","I was a bit skeptical when Baahubali: The Beginning came out. Not being an avid follower of Telugu movies, I didn't know much about any of the cast, let alone the director S.S. Rajamouli. But boy I was wrong, so wrong to have doubted the movie. I loved it and till now watched it more than 10 times.

It did tremendous in box office, but became a all-favorite cult classic during these last three years. Every single Indian film-lovers waited eagerly for this movie. So, naturally I had high hopes about The Conclusion. And I have to say, I loved every single frame of this movie. S.S. Rajamouli's direction was even better in this one, as everyone's eyes were glued to the screen in the theater.Laudable work done by the Editing Team, unlike Baahubali: The Beginning, The Conclusion didn't had a single redundant scene, every side plot had a reason to be in the screenplay. The songs were really mellifluous, and I bet it sounded better in Telugu than Hindi.

If you haven't seen it yet and thinking it's not worth of your time, it's okay. But don't make the mistake of thinking it's a typical Telugu movie. It's unlike anything you've seen before, a masterpiece. The Box Office will say the rest.","i was a bit skeptical when baahubali: the beginning came out. not being an avid follower of telugu movies, i didn't know much about any of the cast, let alone the

Monstrous Movie,"The heading says all of that.

First of all the film starts where it left, Katappa telling story about Baahubali's father and his mother.

There are ups and downs however there is perfect balance between them.

There are some jaw dropping scenes as well.

Among 2 halves, I personally liked the 1st one better than 2nd. That doesn't means that 2nd is not good.

Everyone played their role with true dedication and extreme energy.

The truth behind ""#WKKB or Why Katappa killed Baahubali?"" is also very dramatic though Rajamouli gave perfect answer for that question in the movie.

The climax and the end battle has some great moves and strategies which could be an eye catcher however, I felt it could have been stretched further by eliminating some scenes in the movie which were of no use.

Still it deserves 10/10 and a must watch in Cinema hall.","the heading says all of that. first of all the film starts where it left, katappa telling story about baahubali's father and his mother.

Something In Between an Indian Matrix or a Scary Movie of the Hobbit,"If you think it as comedy flick, you wont be disappointed much. But if you are looking for an epic story of the old ages, here Baahubali lacks 2 essential things: 1 Originality 2 Laws of Physics First of all, there is no logic or no sense of natural laws in both series. Think it as the Matrix movie, but all the events happen somewhere in India during the middle ages. The movie actually has very beautiful colors and costumes and settings and so on so forth... However it is a compilation of complete cliche. It looks like producers tried to imitate some of the very well known major Hollywood scenes but failed miserably. In the end, what they achieved was a poorly made copy paste of lets say; Hobbit/Lotr/Hercules/Thor mix action scenes and stunts. Although I enjoyed some dramatic parts, they ruined those feelings with classical Indian folklore dance and singings. GREAT PEOPLE OF INDIA, WAKE UP!

PART 2 IS PART 1 AND PART WAS PART 2- but Worth it!,"Its obvious: Its the flashback. If you haven't seen part 1 -you should. You can see it in either sequence part1 followed by 2 or part 2 (this one) followed by 1. Everything will make sense. The only thing is the question was more enticing ""Why did Kattappa kill Baahubali?' than the answer. Also you may not be as amazed with this one as the previous one, as you would expect the grandeur and the graphics. But mistake me not, this is as good as it gets.
