            "Example Text: Baahubali 2 (2017) continues the epic silliness of the first Baahubali (2015), with even bigger battles, dance scenes, menacing looks, and muscles. The surprise reveal at the end of part 1 is explained and the circle is completed with the transition of the hero role from Amarendra Baahubali himself to his son, Mahendra Baahubali (both played by Prabhas) (who, as an infant, was saved from his murderous uncle by the queen, as seen in the prologue to the first film). Like its antecedent, this film swings wildly from almost slapstick comedy (e.g. Baahubali passes himself of as a 'blockhead' to get near Princess Devasena) to bloody (if cartoonish) violence including multiple impalements, immolations, and decapitations. The buzz-saw chariot is back (now equipped with a sort of volley-gun arrow launcher) but the tactical highlight is the palm-tree catapults that launch teams of soldiers who to use their shields to form armored balls in mid-air. Even Wile E Coyote would have dismissed this strategy as improbable, but the laws of physics are outrageously ignored throughout most of the action scenes and this is just a particularly egregious (but fun) example. Not surprisingly, most of the film is CGI: very good in places but times looking more like a video-game than an epic, 'live-action' film. As with #1, I watched a subtitled version so can't really comment on the acting but all of the leads still look and sound the part (Anushka Shetty's Devasena and Sathyaraj's Kattappa are particularly good). There were a few weak scenes (the weird flying ship (dream?) sequence comes to mind) that IMO kept #2 from being as overall as good as #1; but, all in all, an over-the-top epic fantasy with perhaps a somewhat different aesthetic than Western audiences are used to (picture Aragorn and Arwen, backed by dancing elves, breaking into a love duet in the middle of the council of Elrond).\n",

Colorful and exciting, it is also exhilarating, though silly in its action and it thus succeeds as a pretty good conclusion to this story. But above all else, both of these films are very enjoyable as they are incredibly epic in scope and world building and in that aspect are much better than most American blockbusters.\n",

            "Example Text: So finally we get to see why Katappa killed baahubali. This was the question that was on everyone's tongue. Baahubali 2 answers the question but it may or may not satisfy you. In fact, there are many twists in this film.Baahubali: The Beginning was a good experience. It was a milestone in terms of VFX. The story line though clichéd was good, the background score was powerful and the cinematography was beautiful. Baahubali 2 is more of what you saw in Baahubali but it fades in comparison. Yes, the fight scenes are on a larger scale than the first one. You may have guessed that from the trailer. Yes, there is a fight scene that we all have been waiting to see. Yes, there are some scenes that would give you an adrenaline rush but in the midst of all this chaos, you feel that something is not right. Something is missing and you don't know what it is.Baahubali: The Beginning was the first film that made us believe that we were able to produce such films. That film single-handedly intrigued us and maybe that is the reason Baahubali 2 does not feel like an original work anymore. It feels like a copy paste of the original without any soul. The screenwriters try to make it work by giving us back stories but some part of it does not fit.Acting performances are okay with most of the good performances coming from prabhas, duggubati and Anushka. Some of the actors are over the top just like the first film.It is also longer than Baahubali which is a treat for the fans. I mean, they deserve it, after all, they have been waiting for two years to see it on the big screen. To the serious movie-goers though, it is a big let down since most of the film could have been edited to make it shorter and to-the-point. Most of the time is wasted on the same things that were the problems with Baahubali - the unnecessary romance and songs. I know, we Indians are used to watching songs but for god's sake, stop doing it. songs do not add any value to the story and they are cringe-worthy. You are making a film that is supposed to be compared with Hollywood's behemoths and then you add a dance sequence to it? That's utterly stupid. It seems to me that this film didn't really need a sequel (but everyone wanted to know why Katappa killed Baahubali). It could have worked as a single film without all the dance and romance.In the end, I would like to say that Baahubali 2 is what fans have been waiting for. They will definitely be happy with the package. It's nothing exceptional though and so some moviegoers might be disappointed. But no matter how well the film is made or how many shortcomings it has, I would still request you to go and watch this film. You need to support it because if it isn't a hit, no one in future will think about taking risks and we'll have to watch the same old Bollywood films for the rest of our lives. Can you tolerate another Happy New Year or Hamshakals?\n",

            "Example Text: Honestly, I do not understand the hype about this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made and a horrid collosial waste of money and time. I wish I could get my money back.It does not take large copious amounts of money and VFX to make a good movie, but rather, the script, editing, direction and acting should be it's strong points. This movie falls flat in all of these.The director treats his entire movie audience as fools by bending the laws of physics as per his whims and fancies and putting in elaborate nonsensical, visualizations and stunts, as and when he desires.It probably, would all have made sense, if the Bahubalis and their army, were mutants or part of the Avengers team. Otherwise, it's only laughable.Some folks, told me to appreciate, \"the effort with which the movie was made and it's grand visuals\". Well, you just cannot appreciate the effort put into this movie, for despite all it's lavishness, it's a bad movie with a clichéd plot line; Which is a shame, as it had potential to be so much more.\n",

            "Example Text: Why so much hatred on this movie. I wonder whether people really watched this movie before giving 1-star ratings. I'm surprised not even single point they liked in this movie. This means when you keep negativity in mind everything looks negative. The sheer collections of this movie in India alone prove how much this movie liked by common movie lover.People who are saying this movie collections are just because of the hype should remember no movie in the world wins the box office just through the hype or publicity. The hype is good for the first day or weekend collections, but once the movie is out only the content wins at the box office. In fact, many times too much hype damages collections if the movie is not up to the mark. I can give you few examples. The Indian superstar Rajinikanth's movie Kabali hyped so high than any movie in India before and not even Baahubali 1 had that much hype. That hype helped to get unimaginable records on the first day and the first weekend, however, the content of the movie is not justifiable over the hype so it just collapsed at the box office. There are plenty of examples like this; another example is South Indian director Shankar's film 'I'. Where Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger came to India to attend the audio function and that created so much buzz. But everyone knows what the result of that movie at the end. Therefore the point is just with hype and publicity no one can make movie run in long run. Also no director in the world can make a movie which satisfies all audiences. Not even James Cameron. When his latest movie Avatar got released there were plenty of people who did not like the movie(IMDb rating 7.8). People questioned what is there in that movie other than spectacle VFX. That is not James Cameron best works compare to his previous movies Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. However, the majority of the people around the world embraced that movie and made it the biggest blockbuster ever in Hollywood film industry.When you are rating this movie keep your negativity aside and watch again, think for a second why Baahubali 2 is able to achieve mind-boggling collections and able to run successfully for 50 days in 1050 centers. If there is nothing in this movie how it would collect that much. Think hard! You will realize the greatness of this movie. If you still not satisfied at least appreciate people's hard work that put their heart and soul in this movie for 5 years.Finally, my review of this movie is as follows.It is most engaging, gripping, jaw-dropping movie that I've seen in recent times. I bet you will get Goosebumps while watching some of the scenes (guaranteed). I've known Rajamouli since his first movie. His biggest strength is his screenplay and emotional drama. He told in many interviews what is his success mantra.1. Elevation scenes: He ensures there is at least one peak/elevation scene in every ten or 15 minutes of the movie even story won't allow for such scenes. IMO this is one of the reasons he takes more time to make movies as to conceive each such scene is not an easy job. This will keep you engaged throughout the movie without any dull movement. If you think the movie as a two-dimensional graph, his movies are like a sine wave except there are no negative values, only positive values occasionally rise to the peak. Keep this point in mind and watch Baahubali 1 and 2. There is always one or two elevation scene(s) in every 10 or 15 minutes. Especially in Baahubali 2, you forget to take the breath! The screenplay is so tight and engaging.2. Emotional drama: He is a true master in emotional drama. The scenes that lead to Kattapa killing Baahubali are an emotional roller coaster. The drama between each of the lead characters is top notch.3. The villain character: Almost in all his movies villain character is more dominant, powerful, charming, intelligent than a hero. He creates more scenes to establish villain. The point here is, the impact that this build-up creates when hero defeats indisputable villain is terrific. Even in Baahubali 2, the villain character is so powerful sometimes you feel it is impossible to defeat him. Overall it's an eye feast to watch this movie. If possible watch it in IMAX or 4K screen.Thanks to Rajamouli for giving such a wonderful masterpiece.\n",

To all the people who claim about the VFX, I am amazed, which visual effects were convincing? The way Bahubali landed like a polystyrene sheet or the palaces and all those unacceptable architecture, the plaster-of-Paris elephants and horses. The action sequences were extreme even from mythological or fantasy point of view. Talking about physics, An apple fell on Newton's head and he asked why?- That's how gravity came to us. SS Rajmauli saw a coconut tree and asked why? When we look at the script almost 80% of the script is trivial, the first half is intolerable especially Prabhas' performance. The reason Kattappa killed Bahubali was acceptable, on the other end nothing else was. Talking about their performance, Rana Daggubati pulled a good role, all the others overacted at some point of time, this includes Prabhas, Satyaraj, Anushka Shetty, Ramya Krishnan etc. Tammannah was barely seen or she would have ruined it more. Over-all a below average movie with a heavy unbearable budget and an unbelievable box office collection.\n",

The graphics/CGI are OK at most parts. The portrayal of animals though(Elephants, horses, bullocks etc) is cartoonish. Heck, even the trees and the leaves falling at some scenes seem artificial. Gladiator, which was released more than 10 years ago has better CGI. The story-line itself isn't so great. Most of it is taken out of Mahabharata. If you are looking for cringe moments, you got plenty. From soldiers flying around by a swing of a sword, the male chauvinistic attitudes (My favorite being appeasing angry mom/mom-in-law by giving her a grandson), the Southern flavored romance between Prabhas and Anushka with a comic sidekick used as a ploy and the best of all: elastic coconut trees slinging soldiers into the castle and they bouncing off their shields unhurt. You name it, you got it. The only saving grace in the move is Anushka Shetty. All in All, this movie is a bad advertisement to Indian cinema. This is the highest grosser of Indian Cinema of which I'm also one of the guilty contributors. I really feel ashamed now.\n",
